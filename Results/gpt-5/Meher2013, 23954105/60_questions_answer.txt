Question: 1101 

Evidence: This chapter focuses on the protein HIV-pr, which is important for the cleavage of Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins to form mature, structural, and functional virions. The effect of the mutations and the varied simulation protocols on conformational dynamics and drug resistance of HIV-pr is discussed. There have been a large number of computer simulation studies to understand the HIV-pr dynamics and drug resistance behavior primarily using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.

Rationale: The text frames the work as a chapter that discusses and reviews the effects of mutations and simulation protocols and cites numerous prior simulation studies. There is no description of new experimental datasets, sequences, clinical cohorts, or newly generated measurements, indicating it does not present previously unpublished primary data.
