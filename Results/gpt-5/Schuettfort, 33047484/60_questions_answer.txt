Question: 1101 

Evidence: We conducted a retrospective, multicentre analysis including people diagnosed with HIV infection with a CD4 cell count < 200 cells/µL and/or an AIDS-defining condition who started ART at one of five European HIV treatment centres based in Frankfurt (Germany), Madrid (Spain) and London (England). To our knowledge, this study is the first to describe discontinuation and virological response in those presenting late for HIV diagnosis and starting treatment with regimens including either an INI or a PI.

Rationale: The paper presents original cohort data collected and analyzed by the authors (retrospective, multicentre study) and explicitly states it is the first to describe these outcomes in this population, indicating the data were previously unpublished.
