Question: 1101 

Evidence: A retrospective study was carried out in which baseline and on-therapy presence of drug resistance mutations in the HIV-1 protease and reverse transcriptase genes were analysed in patients with PLLV between 20 and 250 copies/ml. Resistance analysis was successful for 154 samples collected longitudinally from 23 patients over a median period of 4.7 years (IQR 3.3–5.7).

Rationale: The study describes newly generated data from a retrospective cohort, including longitudinal sequencing and analysis of patient samples; this indicates the paper reports previously unpublished original data rather than a review.
