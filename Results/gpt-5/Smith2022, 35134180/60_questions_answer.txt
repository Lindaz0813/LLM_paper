Question: 1101 

Evidence: We then constructed a library of 95 mutants of HIV-2ROD9 that contained single or multiple amino acid changes in the integrase protein. Each variant was tested for susceptibility to raltegravir and dolutegravir using a single- cycle indicator cell assay. Our analysis demonstrates the contributions of novel INI-associated mutations to raltegravir and dolutegravir resistance in HIV-2.

Rationale: The paper describes new experimental work: construction of 95 site-directed mutants and measurement of their drug susceptibility, yielding original phenotypic resistance data and conclusions about novel mutations. This constitutes previously unpublished data.

Answer: Yes


Question: 1102 

Evidence: We also compiled a list of all integrase sequences from INI-treated, HIV-2--infected patients that were available in the National Center for Biotechnology Information GenBank database (see Supplementary Methods for search terms and inclusion criteria). For each mutant clone, the sequence of the integrase-encoding region was confirmed by automated Sanger DNA sequencing (Genewiz).

Rationale: The study did not generate or present new patient-derived HIV sequences; it compiled existing GenBank sequences and only Sanger-confirmed the engineered integrase region of lab clones. Therefore, it does not report new HIV sequences.

Answer: No


Question: 1103 

Evidence: Each variant was tested for susceptibility to raltegravir and dolutegravir using a single- cycle indicator cell assay. SDM was performed using full-length pROD9 or pNL4-3 as the plasmid template and synthetic oligonucleotides.

Rationale: The methods involve site-directed mutagenesis and single-cycle assays, with no mention of serial in vitro passage/selection experiments. Hence, no in vitro passage results are reported.

Answer: No


Question: 1104 

Evidence: We observed extensive cross-resistance between raltegravir and dolutegravir in HIV-2ROD9. HIV-2–specific integrase mutations Q91R, E92A, A153G, and H157Q/S, which have not been previously characterized, significantly increased the half maximum effective concentration (EC50) for raltegravir when introduced into 1 or more mutational backgrounds; mutations E92A/Q, T97A, and G140A/S conferred similar enhancements of dolutegravir resistance.

Rationale: The paper provides new in vitro susceptibility measurements (EC50s and fold changes) for previously uncharacterized HIV-2 integrase mutations, establishing novel phenotypic data.

Answer: Yes


Question: 2101 

Evidence: We also compiled a list of all integrase sequences from INI-treated, HIV-2--infected patients that were available in the National Center for Biotechnology Information GenBank database (see Supplementary Methods for search terms and inclusion criteria).

Rationale: Since no new sequences were generated or deposited, there are no accession numbers reported for any sequenced isolates, patient-derived or otherwise.

Answer: No


Question: 2103 

Evidence: We also compiled a list of all integrase sequences from INI-treated, HIV-2--infected patients that were available in the National Center for Biotechnology Information GenBank database. For each mutant clone, the sequence of the integrase-encoding region was confirmed by automated Sanger DNA sequencing (Genewiz).

Rationale: The article does not list any GenBank accession numbers; it only mentions using GenBank data and Sanger confirmation of engineered clones. Therefore, accession numbers cannot be provided.

Answer: NA


Question: 2202 

Evidence: Genotypes from 91 INI-treated individuals were extracted from the final collection of 19 research articles (Supplementary Table 2). We also compiled a list of all integrase sequences from INI-treated, HIV-2--infected patients that were available in the National Center for Biotechnology Information GenBank database (see Supplementary Methods for search terms and inclusion criteria).

Rationale: The paper compiles and reports genotypes (mutation lists) from individual INI-treated patients in supplementary materials, constituting lists of mutations per individual.

Answer: Yes


Question: 2301 

Evidence: MAGIC-5A indicator cells and plasmid pROD9, a full-length molecular clone of HIV-2 ROD (group A) were kindly provided by Michael Emerman. Full-length HIV-1 clone pNL4-3 (group M, subtype B) was obtained from Bruce Chesebro.

Answer: HIV-2 group A; HIV-1 group M subtype B


Question: 2303 

Evidence: For each mutant clone, the sequence of the integrase-encoding region was confirmed by automated Sanger DNA sequencing (Genewiz). We performed systematic searches of GenBank and HIV-2 drug resistance literature to identify treatment-associated mutations for phenotypic evaluation.

Rationale: The sequencing performed in this study was to confirm the integrase-encoding region of the engineered clones.

Answer: Integrase (IN) region (within pol)


Question: 2304 

Evidence: For each mutant clone, the sequence of the integrase-encoding region was confirmed by automated Sanger DNA sequencing (Genewiz). We then constructed a library of 95 mutants of HIV-2ROD9 that contained single or multiple amino acid changes in the integrase protein.

Rationale: The integrase gene is part of pol. Sequencing confirmation targeted the integrase-encoding region, thus reporting results of HIV pol sequencing.

Answer: Yes


Question: 2401 

Evidence: We also compiled a list of all integrase sequences from INI-treated, HIV-2--infected patients that were available in the National Center for Biotechnology Information GenBank database (see Supplementary Methods for search terms and inclusion criteria). The resultant collection contained 80 group A, 24 group B, 1 CRF01_AB, and 2 group H sequences.

Rationale: The paper does not specify geographic regions or countries for the sequences; it only describes group classifications and sources (GenBank). Therefore, geographic origins cannot be determined.

Answer: NA


Question: 2402 

Evidence: We also compiled a list of all integrase sequences from INI-treated, HIV-2--infected patients that were available in the National Center for Biotechnology Information GenBank database. The resultant collection contained 80 group A, 24 group B, 1 CRF01_AB, and 2 group H sequences.

Rationale: The study used molecular clones (plasmids) and sequenced those clones, indicating cloning prior to sequencing.

Answer: Yes


Question: 2505 

Evidence: For each mutant clone, the sequence of the integrase-encoding region was confirmed by automated Sanger DNA sequencing (Genewiz). SDM was performed using full-length pROD9 or pNL4-3 as the plasmid template.

Rationale: The sequencing was of engineered plasmid clones via Sanger, not single-genome sequencing of patient-derived templates.

Answer: No


Question: 2506 

Evidence: All mutants were constructed using the QuikChange II XL Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent). Stocks of wild-type and mutant viruses were generated by transient transfection of 293T/17 cells as previously described.

Rationale: The generation of site-directed mutants and production of viral stocks from plasmid DNA constitute molecular cloning.

Answer: Yes


Question: 2601 

Evidence: Stocks of wild-type and mutant viruses were generated by transient transfection of 293T/17 cells as previously described. Single-cycle assays were performed using MAGIC-5A cells as previously described.

Evidence: Stocks of wild-type and mutant viruses were generated by transient transfection of 293T/17 cells as previously described. Single-cycle assays were performed using MAGIC-5A cells as previously described.

Rationale: No PBMC sequencing was performed or reported; therefore, the number is zero.

Answer: 0


Question: 2605 

Evidence: We also compiled a list of all integrase sequences from INI-treated, HIV-2--infected patients that were available in the National Center for Biotechnology Information GenBank database. For each mutant clone, the sequence of the integrase-encoding region was confirmed by automated Sanger DNA sequencing (Genewiz).

Rationale: The study did not obtain sequences from individuals; it either used existing GenBank data or sequenced engineered clones. Thus, there were no sequences obtained from individuals with active replication.

Answer: No


Question: 2606 

Evidence: We also compiled a list of all integrase sequences from INI-treated, HIV-2--infected patients that were available in the National Center for Biotechnology Information GenBank database. For each mutant clone, the sequence of the integrase-encoding region was confirmed by automated Sanger DNA sequencing (Genewiz).

Answer: No


Question: 2701 

Evidence: Cells, Plasmids, and Inhibitors. Single-cycle assays were performed using MAGIC-5A cells as previously described.

Rationale: The study did not collect human samples; therefore, there are no infant/child samples reported.

Answer: No


Question: 2702 

Evidence: Genotypes from 91 INI-treated individuals were extracted from the final collection of 19 research articles (Supplementary Table 2). Single-cycle assays were performed using MAGIC-5A cells as previously described.

Rationale: The paper did not enroll individuals or conduct a clinical trial; it compiled published genotypes and performed laboratory assays.

Answer: No


Question: 2703 

Evidence: Genotypes from 91 INI-treated individuals were extracted from the final collection of 19 research articles (Supplementary Table 2). Single-cycle assays were performed using MAGIC-5A cells as previously described.

Rationale: There were no individuals enrolled in this paper; thus, not all individuals were in a clinical trial.

Answer: No


Question: 3101 

Evidence: SDM was performed using full-length pROD9 or pNL4-3 as the plasmid template. Genotypes from 91 INI-treated individuals were extracted from the final collection of 19 research articles (Supplementary Table 2).

Rationale: The study did not obtain samples from individuals for sequencing; it only compiled genotypes from prior studies. Therefore, the number of individuals with samples obtained for sequencing in this paper is zero.

Answer: 0


Question: 3102

Answer: No


Question: 4101 

Evidence: The resultant collection contained 80 group A, 24 group B, 1 CRF01_AB, and 2 group H sequences, including 6 group A sequences from samples that were obtained prior to the initiation of INI-based ART. Most of the HIV-2 patients in these studies were treated with a regimen that contained raltegravir (n = 80).

Rationale: The “prior to the initiation of INI-based ART” phrase refers to INI exposure, not necessarily overall ART-naivety. The paper does not clarify whether these individuals were ART-naive overall.

Answer: NA


Question: 4102 

Evidence: Genotypes from 91 INI-treated individuals were extracted from the final collection of 19 research articles. Most of the HIV-2 patients in these studies were treated with a regimen that contained raltegravir (n = 80).

Rationale: The compiled sequences are from INI-treated (ARV-experienced) individuals, so the paper reports sequences from ARV-experienced persons.

Answer: Yes


Question: 4103 

Evidence: The resultant collection contained 80 group A, 24 group B, 1 CRF01_AB, and 2 group H sequences, including 6 group A sequences from samples that were obtained prior to the initiation of INI-based ART. Genotypes from 91 INI-treated individuals were extracted from the final collection of 19 research articles.

Rationale: While INI-pre-treatment samples are noted, their overall ART status is not specified. Thus, it cannot be determined whether both ART-naive and ART-experienced sequences are reported.

Answer: NA


Question: 4104 

Evidence: The resultant collection contained … including 6 group A sequences from samples that were obtained prior to the initiation of INI-based ART. Genotypes from 91 INI-treated individuals were extracted from the final collection of 19 research articles.

Rationale: The paper does not specify whether those pre-INI samples were ART-naive overall; exact numbers for ART-naive individuals cannot be determined.

Answer: NA


Question: 4105 

Evidence: Most of the HIV-2 patients in these studies were treated with a regimen that contained raltegravir (n = 80); 2 patients received dolutegravir-based ART … and 6 initially received raltegravir, but were switched to a dolutegravir-containing regimen prior to sample collection. The remaining patients received either elvitegravir (n = 1) or an unspecified INI (n = 2).

Rationale: The presence of “unspecified INI” and varied regimens indicates incomplete and heterogeneous ART histories across individuals.

Answer: No


Question: 4201 

Evidence: We performed systematic searches of GenBank and HIV-2 drug resistance literature to identify treatment-associated mutations for phenotypic evaluation. Each variant was tested for susceptibility to raltegravir and dolutegravir using a single- cycle indicator cell assay.

Rationale: The study focuses on phenotypic resistance testing and mutation analysis rather than epidemiological prevalence of transmitted resistance. No prevalence data are presented.

Answer: No


Question: 4202 

Evidence: We performed systematic searches of GenBank and HIV-2 drug resistance literature to identify treatment-associated mutations for phenotypic evaluation. Each variant was tested for susceptibility to raltegravir and dolutegravir using a single- cycle indicator cell assay.

Rationale: The paper does not analyze or report prevalence of pretreatment drug resistance; its scope is experimental phenotyping.

Answer: No


Question: 4301 

Evidence: Most of the HIV-2 patients in these studies were treated with a regimen that contained raltegravir (n = 80); 2 patients received dolutegravir-based ART without prior treatment with an INI, and 6 initially received raltegravir, but were switched to a dolutegravir-containing regimen prior to sample collection. The remaining patients received either elvitegravir (n = 1) or an unspecified INI (n = 2).

Rationale: The compiled patient data involve integrase inhibitors (raltegravir, dolutegravir, elvitegravir). No other drug classes are specified in the compiled treatment descriptions.

Answer: Integrase inhibitors (INSTIs)


Question: 4302 

Evidence: Most of the HIV-2 patients in these studies were treated with a regimen that contained raltegravir (n = 80). 2 patients received dolutegravir-based ART … 6 initially received raltegravir, but were switched to a dolutegravir-containing regimen … The remaining patients received either elvitegravir (n = 1) or an unspecified INI (n = 2).

Rationale: This explicitly reports individuals who received integrase inhibitors.

Answer: Yes


Question: 4303 

Evidence: Most of the HIV-2 patients in these studies were treated with a regimen that contained raltegravir (n = 80) … The remaining patients received either elvitegravir (n = 1) or an unspecified INI (n = 2).

Rationale: Only integrase inhibitors are described in the compiled treatment information; protease inhibitors are not reported for these individuals.

Answer: No


Question: 4304 

Evidence: Most … were treated with a regimen that contained raltegravir (n = 80); 2 … dolutegravir-based ART … 6 … switched to a dolutegravir-containing regimen … The remaining patients received either elvitegravir (n = 1) or an unspecified INI (n = 2).

Rationale: The individuals received different INI regimens, indicating not all received the same ART.

Answer: No


Question: 4305 

Evidence: Genotypes from 91 INI-treated individuals were extracted from the final collection of 19 research articles. Most … were treated with a regimen that contained raltegravir … [others] received dolutegravir or elvitegravir.

Rationale: The individuals referenced were INI-treated; thus, they were not INSTI-naive.

Answer: No


Question: 4403 

Evidence: 6 initially received raltegravir, but were switched to a dolutegravir-containing regimen prior to sample collection. Most … were treated with a regimen that contained raltegravir (n = 80).

Rationale: The text explicitly states six individuals switched regimens, meaning they received more than one ART regimen.

Answer: 6


Question: 4404 

Evidence: 6 initially received raltegravir, but were switched to a dolutegravir-containing regimen prior to sample collection. The remaining patients received either elvitegravir (n = 1) or an unspecified INI (n = 2).

Rationale: The paper does not specify any individuals receiving more than two regimens; only one switch is described. Thus, the number cannot be determined.

Answer: NA


Question: 4405 

Evidence: Most … were treated with a regimen that contained raltegravir (n = 80) … 6 … were switched to a dolutegravir-containing regimen. The remaining patients received either elvitegravir (n = 1) or an unspecified INI (n = 2).

Rationale: Some individuals switched while others did not, so they did not all receive the same number of regimens.

Answer: No


Question: 4406 

Evidence: 6 initially received raltegravir, but were switched to a dolutegravir-containing regimen prior to sample collection. Most … were treated with a regimen that contained raltegravir (n = 80).

Rationale: Because at least six individuals received more than one regimen, not all individuals received just one regimen.

Answer: No


Question: 4501 

Evidence: 2 patients received dolutegravir-based ART without prior treatment with an INI, and 6 initially received raltegravir, but were switched to a dolutegravir-containing regimen prior to sample collection. Most of the HIV-2 patients in these studies were treated with a regimen that contained raltegravir (n = 80).

Rationale: Adding the two directly on dolutegravir and the six who switched to dolutegravir gives eight individuals who received dolutegravir.

Answer: 8


Question: 4502 

Evidence: Most of the HIV-2 patients in these studies were treated with a regimen that contained raltegravir (n = 80) … The remaining patients received either elvitegravir (n = 1) or an unspecified INI (n = 2). 

Rationale: Darunavir is not mentioned; only integrase inhibitors are listed. The paper does not report darunavir use.

Answer: NA


Question: 5101 

Evidence: Genotypes from 91 INI-treated individuals were extracted from the final collection of 19 research articles. We also compiled a list of all integrase sequences … available in … GenBank.

Rationale: The paper compiles published genotypes but does not enumerate how many individuals had resistance mutations; the information is not provided in the text.

Answer: NA


Question: 5102 

Evidence: Genotypes from 91 INI-treated individuals were extracted from the final collection of 19 research articles. We also compiled a list of all integrase sequences … available in … GenBank.

Rationale: Although sequences came from INI-treated individuals, the paper does not state counts of individuals with INSTI-resistance mutations.

Answer: NA


Question: 5103 

Evidence: We performed systematic searches of GenBank and HIV-2 drug resistance literature to identify treatment-associated mutations for phenotypic evaluation. 

Rationale: The paper focuses on integrase inhibitor resistance; it does not report the number of individuals with TDF (tenofovir) resistance mutations.

Answer: NA


Question: 5104 

Evidence: First, HIV-2 shows some commonality with HIV-1 with regard to INI resistance pathways, as indicated by the frequent appearance of amino acid replacements at positions 92, 97, 140, 143, 148, and 155 of the HIV-2 integrase protein. Second, HIV-2 integrase sequences from INI-treated patients often encode mutations that are not recognized as resistance-conferring changes in HIV-1; these include K46R, I84V, Q91R, A119T, V141I, A153G, A153S, H156R, H157Q, H157R, N160K, and insertions of up to 5 amino acids at position 231.

Rationale: These sentences list INSTI-resistance-associated mutations observed in INI-treated HIV-2 patients and thus reported as developing in individuals.

Answer: E92, T97A, G140A/S, Y143C/G/H/R, Q148H/K/R, N155H; and HIV-2–associated changes including K46R, I84V, Q91R, A119T, V141I, A153G/S, H156R, H157Q/R, N160K, and insertions at position 231


Question: 6101 

Evidence: Single-cycle assays were performed using MAGIC-5A cells as previously described, except that the viral titers were adjusted to 15 000 FFU/mL prior to inoculation. After approximately 40 hours of infection, the MAGIC-5A monolayers were lysed … and β-galactosidase activity was measured by treating the lysates with chlorophenol red-β-d-galactopyranoside.

Rationale: The phenotypic susceptibility method is a single-cycle indicator cell assay (MAGIC-5A) measuring β-galactosidase activity.

Answer: Single-cycle MAGIC-5A indicator cell assay measuring β-galactosidase activity (CPRG readout)


Question: 6102 

Evidence: Half maximum effective concentration (EC50) values were calculated from semilog plots of the dose-response data using the sigmoidal regression function of Prism. Bars indicate mean EC50 values ± 1 SD.

Rationale: The study reports EC50 values for drug susceptibility, which are analogous to IC50 measurements.

Answer: Yes


Question: 6103 

Evidence: However, mutants encoding E92A and E92Q … exhibited low-level resistance to dolutegravir (2.5- to 2.6-fold increase in EC50 relative to wild-type HIV-2ROD9). In addition, all 7 of the multiply substituted mutants were resistant to raltegravir, with up to a 28-fold increase in the EC50 value.

Rationale: The paper provides fold changes in EC50 (i.e., IC50-equivalent fold changes), indicating novel fold-change data.

Answer: Yes


Question: 6104 

Evidence: Single-cycle assays were performed using MAGIC-5A cells as previously described. After approximately 40 hours of infection … β-galactosidase activity was measured … 

Rationale: This describes the specific phenotypic susceptibility assay used: a single-cycle indicator cell assay in MAGIC-5A cells with β-gal readout.

Answer: MAGIC-5A single-cycle indicator cell assay (β-galactosidase/CPRG readout)


Question: 6105 

Evidence: the T97A + Y143C mutant of HIV-2ROD9 … shows poor replication capacity in single-round infections [44], and fails to produce detectable levels of virus in spreading infections of CEM-ss cells [12]. 

Rationale: Replication capacity is mentioned referencing prior work; the present paper does not present new replication capacity measurements.

Answer: No


Question: 6106 

Evidence: Each variant was tested for susceptibility to raltegravir and dolutegravir using a single- cycle indicator cell assay. We observed extensive cross-resistance between raltegravir and dolutegravir in HIV-2ROD9.
