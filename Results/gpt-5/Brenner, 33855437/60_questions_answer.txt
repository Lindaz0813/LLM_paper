Question: 1101 

Evidence: In this study, we performed in vitro cell culture selections with clinical viral isolates to compare emergent resistance to doravirine versus rilpivirine alone and in combination with lamivudine or islatravir. Our results revealed a favourable drug resistance profile for doravirine when compared with other NNRTIs currently in use.
