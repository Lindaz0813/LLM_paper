Question: 7101 

Evidence: Viral RNA was isolated from plasma samples ... The HIV-1 protease and part of reverse transcriptase regions of the pol gene was sequenced ... following the manufacturer's protocol [ 13 ].

Rationale: Sequences were derived from clinical plasma viruses; there is no indication of site-directed mutagenesis-derived isolates.

Answer: No

Question: 7102 

Evidence: Viral RNA was isolated from plasma samples ... The HIV-1 protease and part of reverse transcriptase regions of the pol gene was sequenced ... using the Applied Biosystems 3130xl genetic analyzer or TruGene DNA Sequencing System ...

Rationale: The study did not perform in vitro passage; it sequenced viruses directly from patient plasma.

Answer: No
