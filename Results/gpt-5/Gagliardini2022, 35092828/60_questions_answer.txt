Question: 1101 

Evidence: This is a retrospective observational study performed on the Antiviral Response Cohort Analysis (ARCA) database, which contains data on HIV resistance and ART from more than 40 000 patients in Italy. We selected treatment-experienced patients with HIV-1 switching to a 2DR containing DTG with 3TC or RPV or to a 3DR containing DTG with TDF/FTC or TAF/FTC or ABC/3TC from 2013 to 2019.

Rationale: The paper presents a new observational analysis of ARCA cohort data specific to dolutegravir-based 2DR vs 3DR, including selection criteria, endpoints, and results not previously reported. Hence it reports previously unpublished cohort results.
