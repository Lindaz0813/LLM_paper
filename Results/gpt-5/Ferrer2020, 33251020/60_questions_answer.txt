Question: 2605 

Evidence: Raltegravir (RAL) was the first INSTI used in Chile in 2008, initially only as part of a salvage regimen in patients with virological failure (VF) (2 consecutive viral loads >1000 HIV-1 copies/mL). At failure of RAL-based regimen, median CD4 T lymphocyte count was 186 (range: 9–868) cells/μL and median viral load (VL) was 398,500 (range: 1200–2,700,000) HIV-1 copies/mL.

Rationale: High viral loads and virological failure indicate active viral replication in these individuals.

Answer: Yes


Question: 2606 

Evidence: When performing genotyping HIV-1 RNA was automatically extracted using EasyMag (bioMérieux). Genotypic resistance test for INSTIs was conducted according to the method described by Harrigan et al.

Evidence: We have enrolled into an observational study ... patients on long-term salvage regimen with VF on RAL. RAL was introduced in these patients after an average of 4 therapeutic regimens (range: 2–7).

Rationale: Participants had already received integrase inhibitors (raltegravir) and thus were not INSTI-naive.

Answer: No


Question: 4403 

Evidence: RAL was introduced in these patients after an average of 4 therapeutic regimens (range: 2–7). Our observational study included 44 HIV-1 positive participants.

Rationale: Since the minimum number of regimens before RAL was two, all 44 received more than one ART regimen.

Question: 5101 

Evidence: We found 12/44 (27.3%) patients showing resistance to INSTIs. Genotypic reports showed resistance to reverse transcriptase or protease inhibitors.

Rationale: The exact number with any drug resistance mutations across all classes is not quantified except for INSTIs; the statement about RT/PI resistance lacks a specific count.

Answer: NA


Question: 5102 

Evidence: We found 12/44 (27.3%) patients showing resistance to INSTIs (1 with resistance to RAL, 6 to RAL and EVG, and 5 to all INSTIs). Table 1 shows that 12 patients were resistant to RAL.
