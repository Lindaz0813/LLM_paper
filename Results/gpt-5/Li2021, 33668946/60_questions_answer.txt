Rationale: Although K65R (a key TDF-resistance mutation) is reported with subtype-specific counts, the total number across all individuals and thresholds is not comprehensively enumerated for the entire cohort.

Answer: NA


Question: 5104 

Evidence: Extracted RNA was used for amplification of the PR region and the partial RT region of the HIV-1 pol gene region. The study did not sequence the integrase gene and does not report INSTI resistance mutations.
