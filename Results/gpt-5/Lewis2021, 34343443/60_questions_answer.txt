Question: 1101 

Evidence: Herein we examine the V3-loop sequences and maraviroc susceptibility of viruses from 704 participants receiving maraviroc in relation to clinical outcome, background regimen antiretroviral activity, and adherence in the MOTIVATE 1 and 2 studies. Week 24 sequence data have previously been submitted to GenBank (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA), accession numbers KT452108 to KT452130, KT452143 to KT452286, KT452311 to KT452358, and KT452383 to KT452526. A V3-loop consensus sequence and variants were derived and compared with a V3-loop reference consensus sequence.

Rationale: The paper describes new analyses linking pretreatment V3-loop sequences from 704 trial participants to clinical outcomes and provides GenBank accessions for sequences generated in this work. These indicate the reporting of original datasets that were not previously published in a journal article.
