Evidence: Plasma samples from 100 persons ... after 6 months of nevirapine (NVP)- and/or efavirenz (EFV)-containing ART ... were used in this study. These samples contained a median of three NNRTI-associated drug resistance mutations and the majority (94/100) of these samples also contained at least one NRTI resistance mutation.

Rationale: The paper notes first-line NNRTI-based ART exposure but does not provide detailed ART histories for each participant; thus, complete histories are not provided.

Answer: No

Question: 4406 

Evidence: Plasma samples from 100 persons ... after 6 months of nevirapine (NVP)- and/or efavirenz (EFV)-containing ART.

Answer: NA


Question: 4502 

Evidence: Plasma samples from 100 persons ... after 6 months of nevirapine (NVP)- and/or efavirenz (EFV)-containing ART. 

Rationale: The paper does not mention darunavir or protease inhibitor use; therefore, the number receiving darunavir cannot be determined.

Answer: 100


Question: 5102 

Evidence: Full-length HIV-1 RT ... were sequenced. 

Rationale: Only reverse transcriptase (part of pol) was sequenced; integrase was not sequenced or analyzed, so INSTI-resistance mutations were not assessed.

Rationale: K65R is a key tenofovir (TDF) resistance mutation; the paper states there were 35 K65R-containing recombinants, indicating 35 individuals with a TDF-resistance mutation.

Answer: 35


Question: 5104 

Evidence: Full-length HIV-1 RT ... were sequenced. 

Rationale: The study did not sequence or analyze integrase; therefore, no INSTI-resistance mutations were reported.

Answer: NA

Question: 6105 

Evidence: A relative light unit (RLU)-normalized input was used to infect untreated or ETR-treated TZM-bl cells ... to generate EC50 values. 

Rationale: The phenotypic testing focused on drug susceptibility (EC50/FC) and did not report replication capacity measurements.

Answer: No


Question: 6106 

Evidence: Wild-type plasma-derived recombinant viruses ... showed mean ETR 50% effective concentration (EC50) of 0.99 ± 0.28 nM. To assess if the discordance was specific to ETR, we tested the correlation ... to the NNRTI rilpivirine (RPV). In contrast, the NRTI mutation M184V was not associated with ETR resistance ... and there was no association between the K65R mutation and RPV or dapivirine (DPV) resistance (Fig. S4B).

Rationale: Etravirine was the primary drug tested; additional phenotyping and analyses involved rilpivirine and dapivirine.
