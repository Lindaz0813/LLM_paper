Question: 1101 

Evidence: Objectives: To complete INSTI resistance data on HIV-2 by determining the viral replicative capacity and INSTI phenotypic susceptibility of integrase mutants obtained through site-directed mutagenesis. These first data on the newly described resistance pathway 231ins, using site-directed mutagenesis, showed no measurable impact on viral fitness and confirmed the decreased susceptibility to a first-generation INSTI (raltegravir) and cabotegravir.

Rationale: The paper states it aims to generate new data via site-directed mutagenesis and explicitly refers to “These first data” on the 231ins pathway, indicating previously unpublished experimental findings.

Answer: Yes


Question: 1102 

Evidence: Single, double and triple integrase mutants were obtained by sequential site-directed mutagenesis using the plasmid ROD9 containing the whole viral genome of the group A HIV-2 reference strain.

Answer: No


Question: 1104
