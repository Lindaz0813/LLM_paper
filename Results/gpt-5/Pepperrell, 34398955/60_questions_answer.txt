Question: 1101 

Evidence: In this analysis, our aim was to validate earlier published data from the ADVANCE trial that showed that participants resuppress HIV RNA on DTG-based regimens despite protocol-defined virological failure [4]. This is greater than the previous numbers reported in the week 96 analysis due to additional follow-up data being available [5].

Rationale: The paper explicitly states it is providing updated follow-up data beyond prior publications (week 96), indicating that new, previously unpublished results are included.

Answer: Yes
