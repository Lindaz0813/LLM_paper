Question: 1101 

Evidence: The newly reported integrase sequences have been submitted to GenBank under accession numbers OM877162–OM877261. These 100 sequences, that cover at least amino acid positions 66 to 263 of the HIV integrase gene, were interpreted using the HIV French Resistance algorithm.

Rationale: The paper states that it generated “newly reported” integrase sequences and deposited them in GenBank, indicating the data had not been previously published. The description of sequencing and interpretation confirms original data generation.

Answer: Yes


Question: 1102 

Evidence: The newly reported integrase sequences have been submitted to GenBank under accession numbers OM877162–OM877261. These 100 sequences, that cover at least amino acid positions 66 to 263 of the HIV integrase gene, were interpreted using the HIV French Resistance algorithm.

Evidence: Overall, we recruited 103 individuals tested positive for the first-time for HIV-1 infection. These 100 sequences, that cover at least amino acid positions 66 to 263 of the HIV integrase gene, were interpreted using the HIV French Resistance algorithm.

Rationale: The study involves clinical samples from individuals and genotypic analysis; there is no mention of in vitro passage experiments. Hence, the paper does not report results from in vitro passage.

Answer: No


Question: 1104 

Evidence: These 100 sequences, that cover at least amino acid positions 66 to 263 of the HIV integrase gene, were interpreted using the HIV French Resistance algorithm. Recent phenotypic assessments of this mutation in context of CRF02_AG viruses showed a fold change in EC50 of 1.1, 1.9 and 2.4 for raltegravir, dolutegravir and elvitegravir, respectively.

Rationale: The paper performed genotypic analysis only and cites phenotypic results from another study rather than conducting its own in vitro susceptibility testing. Therefore, it does not report in vitro antiretroviral susceptibility data of its own.

Answer: No
