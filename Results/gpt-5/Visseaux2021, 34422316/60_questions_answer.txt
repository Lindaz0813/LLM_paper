Rationale: The paper mentions resistance-associated mutations in general terms but does not provide lists of mutations per individual sequence.

Answer: No


Question: 2301 

Evidence: To date, HIV-2 has been classified into ten distinct groups named A, B, C, D, E, F1, F2, G, H, and I. All HIV-2 group A and B sequences generated for drug resistance monitoring or research purpose within the French ANRS CO5 HIV-2 cohort since 1994 were analysed.

Rationale: The study focuses on HIV-2, particularly groups A and B, not HIV-1.

Answer: HIV-2

Inland western countries (i.e. Mali and Burkina-Faso) and coastal Southern countries (i.e. Ivory Coast, Ghana, Togo, Nigeria and Cameroon) were dominated by A2 and B lineages. Outside of Western Africa, the sequences sampled in Portugal were exclusively of A1 viruses while a mixture … were found in patients born in France.

Rationale: The study specifies the countries of origin/sampling, including multiple West African countries, Portugal, and France.

Answer: Cape Verde, Senegal, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, Mali, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Togo, Nigeria, Cameroon, Portugal, and France

Answer: NA


Question: 2606 

Evidence: Viral clones, duplicates, lab strains and sequential sequencing were excluded. The paper does not specify whether sequences came from proviral DNA reservoirs.

Rationale: The source (plasma RNA vs proviral DNA) is not given.

Question: 3101 

Evidence: 444 partial pol … sequences from 291 patients. 129 partial env … sequences from 106 unique patients … 152 complete vif … sequences from 147 patients … and 74 long terminal repeats (LTR …) sequences from 74 patients (including 53 not present in other datasets).

Rationale: The total number of unique cohort individuals with sequences can be inferred by adding patients in pol (291) plus those only present in other datasets: env-only (20), vif-only (33), and LTR-only (53), yielding 291 + 20 + 33 + 53 = 397 unique patients.

Answer: 397 (French ANRS CO5 cohort unique patients with sequences)


Question: 3102
