Question: 1101 

Evidence: To investigate antiviral potency of the 2-drug regimen (2DR) dolutegravir plus lamivudine vs the 3-drug regimen (3DR) dolutegravir plus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine, we performed a post-hoc analysis assessing antiviral response rates in the phase III GEMINI-1 and GEMINI-2 studies by baseline viral load (VL). Proportion of participants achieving plasma VL <50 copies/mL (Snapshot algorithm) or <40 copies/mL (Abbott RealTime HIV-1 assay) and target not detected was assessed through week 48 by baseline VL.

Rationale: The paper explicitly states it conducted a post-hoc pooled analysis of existing trials focusing on outcomes by baseline viral load and additional exploratory TND analyses. These constitute new analyses and results not previously published in the original primary reports.
