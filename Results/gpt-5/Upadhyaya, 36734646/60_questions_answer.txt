Question: 1101 

Evidence: Molecular docking calculations for all the selected inhibitors were performed with 4 different HIV-1 integrase receptors collected from protein data bank and 30 docked poses were generated for each inhibitor. We designed a few inhibitors on the basis of the structure activity relationship and predicted their pIC50 values by using generated analogue/ligand-based models, Table S6.

Rationale: The paper presents original computational results (docking across multiple receptors, MD simulations, thermodynamic analyses, QSAR models) and new predictions for designed inhibitors, which constitute previously unpublished data produced by the authors rather than a review of existing results.
