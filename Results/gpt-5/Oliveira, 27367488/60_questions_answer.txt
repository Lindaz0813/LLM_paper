Question: 1101 

Evidence: We performed tissue culture selection experiments using reverse transcriptase inhibitor-resistant viruses containing resistance substitutions at positions K65R, M184I or M184V in the presence of increasing concentrations of RAL, EVG or DTG and monitored changes in integrase sequences by genotyping. Our results show that these NRTI- resistant mutations prevented the facile emergence of resistance mutations against DTG but not against RAL or EVG.

Rationale: The paper describes new experiments and new findings about how specific RT mutations affect emergence of INSTI resistance, indicating that it reports previously unpublished data.

Answer: Yes


Question: 1102 

Evidence: Emerging resistance mutations in integrase were detected by extraction of viral RNA from culture fluids using the QIAamp Viral RNA Extraction kit (Qiagen, Toronto, Ontario, Canada), followed by reverse transcription, amplification by PCR and sequencing, as previously described. Next, we monitored the emergence of mutations in the integrase coding region by sequencing at different time points.

Rationale: The authors performed and reported sequencing of HIV integrase (and monitored RT changes), thus the paper reports HIV sequences/mutations.

Question: 1103 

Evidence: We performed tissue culture selection experiments using reverse transcriptase inhibitor-resistant viruses containing resistance substitutions at positions K65R, M184I or M184V in the presence of increasing concentrations of RAL, EVG or DTG.

Answer: Yes


Question: 1104 

Evidence: First, we monitored the concentrations of DTG, EVG or RAL at which the wild-type (WT) and various mutated HIV-1 viruses were able to replicate over time. After 20 weeks of culture, RAL, EVG and DTG concentrations were 0.5 μmol/l, 0.5 μmol/l and 25 nmol/l, respectively.

Answer: Yes


Question: 2301 

Evidence: The M184I/V and K65R nucleoside resistance mutations in HIV-1 prevent the emergence of resistance mutations against dolutegravir. First, we monitored the concentrations of DTG, EVG or RAL at which the wild-type (WT) and various mutated HIV-1 viruses were able to replicate over time.

Answer: NA


Question: 2303 

Evidence: Next, we monitored the emergence of mutations in the integrase coding region by sequencing at different time points. No additional mutations in reverse transcriptase were observed during our tissue culture selection experiments.

Question: 2506 

Evidence: We did not perform clonal analyses of these viruses. Viruses were produced from previously described pNL4.3 plasmids that were generated by site-directed mutagenesis.
