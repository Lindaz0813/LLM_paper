Answer: Yes


Question: 2503 

Evidence: We performed HIV genotypic resistance testing … using a validated in-house Sanger sequencing assay. The HIV polymerase sequences … were generated from chromatogram data using RECall.

Rationale: The exclusive mention of Sanger sequencing and lack of any NGS platform indicates NGS was not used.

Answer: No


Question: 2504 

Evidence: We performed HIV genotypic resistance testing on plasma samples … using a validated in-house Sanger sequencing assay. The HIV polymerase sequences spanning the entire protease … and reverse transcriptase … were generated from chromatogram data using RECall.

Rationale: The paper describes direct Sanger population sequencing from plasma without mentioning cloning; since cloning is not stated, whether samples were cloned cannot be determined definitively.

Answer: NA


Question: 2505 

Evidence: We performed HIV genotypic resistance testing … using a validated in-house Sanger sequencing assay. The HIV polymerase sequences … were generated from chromatogram data using RECall.

Rationale: There is no mention of single-genome sequencing; only bulk Sanger sequencing is described, so this cannot be confirmed from the text.

Answer: No


Question: 2506 

Evidence: We performed HIV genotypic resistance testing … using a validated in-house Sanger sequencing assay. The HIV polymerase sequences … were generated from chromatogram data using RECall.

Rationale: Molecular cloning is not described; the paper reports population Sanger sequencing from plasma. As cloning is not mentioned, it cannot be determined with certainty.

Answer: NA


Question: 2601 

Evidence: We performed HIV genotypic resistance testing on plasma samples of participants with nonsuppressed VLs using a validated in-house Sanger sequencing assay. 

Rationale: The sequencing was performed on plasma samples, confirming plasma HIV sequencing.

Answer: Yes

Evidence: We performed HIV genotypic resistance testing on plasma samples of participants with nonsuppressed VLs. Of the 48 virological nonsuppressors successfully genotyped, 39 (81.3%) had HIV variants with predicted resistance to at least one of the recommended drugs.

Rationale: Genotyping (from plasma) was successful for 48 individuals; therefore, 48 plasma virus sequences were reported.

Answer: 48


Question: 2604 

Evidence: We performed HIV genotypic resistance testing on plasma samples of participants with nonsuppressed VLs. 

Rationale: The paper does not report PBMC sequencing; hence, the number of PBMC sequences is zero.

Answer: 0


Question: 2605 

Evidence: Based on the Ugandan national HIV treatment guidelines, participants with VL ≥1,000 copies/mL were regarded as virologically nonsuppressed. We performed HIV genotypic resistance testing on plasma samples of participants with nonsuppressed VLs.

Rationale: Sequencing targeted individuals with VL ≥1,000 copies/mL, indicating active viral replication.

Answer: Yes


Question: 2606 

Evidence: We performed HIV genotypic resistance testing on plasma samples of participants with nonsuppressed VLs. 

Rationale: Sequencing was done on plasma RNA, not proviral DNA; thus, sequences were not obtained from the proviral DNA reservoir.

Answer: No


Question: 2701 

Evidence: Our analyses included all HIV-positive FSWs 18 years of age and older, who were receiving first-line ART. 

Rationale: Participants were adults (≥18 years), so no infants/children were included.

Answer: No


Question: 2702 

Evidence: This was a cross-sectional study conducted in an open cohort of women attending the GHWP-clinic implementing HIV "test and treat" policy, between 2015 and 2018. 

Rationale: The study is observational within a clinic cohort, not a clinical trial.

Answer: No


Question: 2703 

Evidence: This was a cross-sectional study conducted in an open cohort of women attending the GHWP-clinic. 

Rationale: Because it was not a clinical trial, not all individuals (indeed none) were in a clinical trial.

Answer: No


Question: 3101 

Evidence: Of the 48 virological nonsuppressors successfully genotyped, 39 (81.3%) had HIV variants with predicted resistance to at least one of the recommended drugs. We performed HIV genotypic resistance testing on plasma samples of participants with nonsuppressed VLs.

Rationale: Although genotyping was attempted on those with nonsuppression, the number of individuals with actual sequencing results (successfully genotyped) was 48.

Answer: 48


Question: 3102 

Evidence: We performed HIV genotypic resistance testing on plasma samples of participants with nonsuppressed VLs. Of the 267 participants, 203 had VL <1,000 RNA copies/mL, hence the overall prevalence of VS of 76.0%.

Rationale: Only those with VL ≥1,000 copies/mL were selected for sequencing, so not all participants underwent HIV sequencing.

Answer: No


Question: 4101 

Evidence: Our analyses included all HIV-positive FSWs 18 years of age and older, who were receiving first-line ART, including those with previous ART exposure. 

Rationale: All sequenced participants were on ART; no ART-naive individuals were sequenced.

Answer: No


Question: 4102 

Evidence: Our analyses included all HIV-positive FSWs … who were receiving first-line ART, including those with previous ART exposure. Of the 48 virological nonsuppressors successfully genotyped, 39 (81.3%) had HIV variants with predicted resistance to at least one of the recommended drugs.

Rationale: The sequenced individuals were receiving ART, and some had prior ART exposure, indicating sequences from ARV-experienced individuals.

Answer: Yes


Question: 4103 

Evidence: Our analyses included all HIV-positive FSWs … who were receiving first-line ART, including those with previous ART exposure. 

Rationale: There is no mention of sequencing ART-naive individuals; therefore, sequences were not from both naive and experienced groups.

Answer: No


Question: 4104 

Evidence: Our analyses included all HIV-positive FSWs … who were receiving first-line ART, including those with previous ART exposure. 

Rationale: Since all sequenced participants were on ART, there were no ART-naive samples sequenced.

Answer: 0


Question: 4105 

Evidence: Our analyses included … who were receiving first-line ART, including those with previous ART exposure. The majority of participants (97.4%) were on tenofovir (TDF) + lamivudine (3TC) + EFV ART regimen.

Rationale: The paper reports current regimens and notes prior exposure but does not provide complete longitudinal ART histories for all individuals; thus, complete ART history information is not provided.

Answer: No


Question: 4201 

Evidence: No participant had acquired resistance mutations to PIs, although in our secondary analysis, one participant (2.1%; 1/48) had a transmitted PI SDRM, M46L present with both NRTI and NNRTI SDRMs. 

Rationale: The paper reports a specific proportion (2.1%) of sequences with a transmitted PI SDRM, which constitutes information on the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance within the sequenced subset.

Answer: Yes


Question: 4202 

Evidence: Furthermore, we never assessed for pretreatment drug resistance, which potentially drives VF or subsequent accumulation of additional resistance mutations over time post-ART initiation.

Rationale: The authors state explicitly that pretreatment drug resistance was not assessed, so no prevalence information is provided.

Answer: No


Question: 4301 

Evidence: In the GHWP-clinic, HIV-positive FSWs initiating ART received the recommended first-line ART regimen of two NRTIs and one NNRTI. The majority of participants (97.4%) were on tenofovir (TDF) + lamivudine (3TC) + EFV ART regimen.

Rationale: Participants received combinations of NRTIs and NNRTIs as part of first-line ART.

Answer: NRTIs and NNRTIs


Question: 4302 

Evidence: The majority of participants (97.4%) were on tenofovir (TDF) + lamivudine (3TC) + EFV ART regimen. Currently, the Ugandan MoH is switching patients from NNRTI-based regimens to more potent Dolutegravir (DTG)-based first- and second-line ART regimens.

Rationale: Regimens in this cohort were NNRTI-based, and DTG use is discussed as a policy change rather than received by study participants, so no individuals receiving integrase inhibitors are reported.

Answer: No


Question: 4303 

Evidence: In the GHWP-clinic, … The second-line ART regimen consisted of two NRTIs unused in the first-line regimen with a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (PI). The majority of participants (97.4%) were on tenofovir (TDF) + lamivudine (3TC) + EFV ART regimen.

Rationale: Although PIs are mentioned as components of second-line regimens, participants in the study were overwhelmingly on NNRTI-based first-line therapy; no individual-level receipt of PIs is reported.

Answer: No


Question: 4304 

Evidence: The majority of participants (97.4%) were on tenofovir (TDF) + lamivudine (3TC) + EFV ART regimen. Other recorded first-line regimens were AZT +3TC + EFV, AZT +3TC + NVP, and TDF +3TC + NVP.

Rationale: Multiple different first-line regimens were used, indicating not all individuals received the same ART.

Answer: No


Question: 4305 

Evidence: The majority of participants (97.4%) were on tenofovir (TDF) + lamivudine (3TC) + EFV ART regimen. The new national guidelines recommend phasing out all NNRTIs and replacing them with Dolutegravir.

Rationale: No integrase inhibitors were part of the reported regimens, indicating the individuals were INSTI-naive.

Answer: Yes


Question: 4403 

Evidence: In the GHWP-clinic, … For individuals with persistent VF, a regimen switch is done. The majority of participants (97.4%) were on tenofovir (TDF) + lamivudine (3TC) + EFV ART regimen.

Rationale: The paper does not report how many individuals changed regimens; it only states that switching is done for persistent VF, so the number receiving more than one regimen is not provided.

Answer: NA


Question: 4404 

Evidence: In the GHWP-clinic, … For individuals with persistent VF, a regimen switch is done. 

Rationale: There is no count of individuals receiving more than two regimens reported.

Answer: NA


Question: 4405 

Evidence: The majority of participants (97.4%) were on tenofovir (TDF) + lamivudine (3TC) + EFV ART regimen. For individuals with persistent VF, a regimen switch is done.

Rationale: The paper does not state the number of regimens per individual; therefore, whether all received the same number of regimens cannot be determined.

Answer: NA


Question: 4406 

Evidence: The majority of participants (97.4%) were on tenofovir (TDF) + lamivudine (3TC) + EFV ART regimen. Other recorded first-line regimens were AZT +3TC + EFV, AZT +3TC + NVP, and TDF +3TC + NVP.

Rationale: The paper lists current regimens but does not confirm that all individuals received exactly one regimen throughout; this cannot be determined.

Answer: NA


Question: 4501 

Evidence: The majority of participants (97.4%) were on tenofovir (TDF) + lamivudine (3TC) + EFV ART regimen. Currently, the Ugandan MoH is switching patients from NNRTI-based regimens to more potent Dolutegravir (DTG)-based first- and second-line ART regimens.

Rationale: DTG is discussed as a transition policy and not as part of participants’ reported regimens; thus, no individuals in this cohort are reported to have received dolutegravir.

Answer: 0


Question: 4502 

Evidence: None of the sequences had predicted resistance to the ritonavir-boosted PIs, atazanavir and lopinavir, which are recommended components of Uganda's second-line regimen. 

Rationale: Darunavir is not listed among the recommended PIs in this setting and there is no report of participants receiving it; therefore, none are reported to have received darunavir.

Answer: 0


Question: 5101 

Evidence: Of the 48 virological nonsuppressors successfully genotyped, 39 (81.3%) had HIV variants with predicted resistance to at least one of the recommended drugs. Table 4. The Distribution of Surveillance Drug Resistance Mutations in 39 Virological Nonsuppressors.

Rationale: The paper explicitly states 39 of 48 had resistance and provides a table of their SDRMs.

Answer: 39


Question: 5102 

Evidence: The HIV polymerase sequences spanning the entire protease … and reverse transcriptase … were generated. Although the high prevalence of NNRTI-associated mutations in this study supports the current transition to DTG, we did not analyze for resistance to DTG.

Rationale: Integrase was not sequenced or analyzed; therefore, no INSTI resistance mutations were reported.

Answer: 0


Question: 5103 

Evidence: For the NRTIs, the prevalence of HIV ADR to both 3TC and FTC was 45.8%, while 22.9% of virological nonsuppressors had HIV variants resistant to TDF. 

Rationale: 22.9% of 48 genotyped individuals corresponds to 11 individuals with TDF resistance.

Answer: 11


Question: 5104 

Evidence: The HIV polymerase sequences spanning the entire protease … and reverse transcriptase … were generated. We did not analyze for resistance to DTG.

Rationale: The study did not sequence integrase or analyze INSTI resistance; hence no INSTI-resistance mutations were reported.

Answer: None


Question: 6101 

Evidence: We assessed HIVDR using the Stanford HIVdb algorithm Version 8.9. Following the WHO criteria, all sequences classified as low-, intermediate-, or high-level resistance were reported as resistant.

Rationale: Resistance was inferred genotypically; no phenotypic susceptibility testing method was used or described.

Answer: NA


Question: 6102 

Evidence: We assessed HIVDR using the Stanford HIVdb algorithm Version 8.9. 

Rationale: No IC50/IC90 values are reported since the study used genotypic predictions rather than phenotypic assays.

Answer: No


Question: 6103 

Evidence: We assessed HIVDR using the Stanford HIVdb algorithm Version 8.9. 

Rationale: The paper does not report IC50 fold-change values; it reports predicted resistance levels from a genotypic algorithm.

Answer: No


Question: 6104 

Evidence: We assessed HIVDR using the Stanford HIVdb algorithm Version 8.9. 

Rationale: No phenotypic assay was used; therefore, no phenotypic susceptibility assay is reported.

Answer: NA


Question: 6105 

Evidence: We assessed HIVDR using the Stanford HIVdb algorithm Version 8.9. 

Rationale: Replication capacity data are not mentioned; the focus is genotypic resistance prediction.

Answer: No


Question: 6106 

Evidence: We assessed HIVDR using the Stanford HIVdb algorithm Version 8.9. None of the sequences had predicted resistance to the ritonavir-boosted PIs, atazanavir and lopinavir, which are recommended components of Uganda's second-line regimen.

Rationale: No phenotypic susceptibility testing was performed; hence, no drugs were phenotypically tested.

Answer: NA


Question: 7101 

Evidence: We performed HIV genotypic resistance testing on plasma samples of participants with nonsuppressed VLs using a validated in-house Sanger sequencing assay. 

Rationale: The sequences are derived from clinical plasma samples, not site-directed mutants engineered in vitro.

Answer: No


Question: 7102 

Evidence: This was a cross-sectional study conducted in an open cohort of women … between 2015 and 2018. We performed HIV genotypic resistance testing on plasma samples of participants with nonsuppressed VLs.

Rationale: The study did not perform in vitro passage experiments; it analyzed clinical samples from participants.

Answer: No
