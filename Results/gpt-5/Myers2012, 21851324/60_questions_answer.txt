Answer: Yes


Question: 1102 

Evidence: Plasma was collected in Santo Domingo at the time of entry into the study and sent in batches several times yearly to the reference laboratory for genotype testing and subtype analysis using the GeneSeq HIV assay. Of the 103 samples sequenced, all were classified as subtype B.

Answer: Yes


Question: 1103 

Evidence: Plasma was collected in Santo Domingo at the time of entry into the study and sent in batches several times yearly to the reference laboratory for genotype testing and subtype analysis using the GeneSeq HIV assay. This assay reports population-based amino acid coding sequences from amino acids 1 to 305 for the reverse transcriptase (RT) and 1 to 99 for the protease (PR).

Rationale: The methods describe clinical sample genotyping of RT and PR using a commercial assay; there is no mention of laboratory in vitro passage experiments. Therefore, the study does not report in vitro passage experiments.

Answer: No


Question: 1104 

Evidence: Mutations were classified as TDR according to the WHO list of surveillance drug resistance mutations (SDRM) because of its focus on nonpolymorphic mutations. The specific SDRMs are shown in Table 2.

Rationale: The paper reports genotypic resistance mutations and does not present any phenotypic susceptibility or in vitro drug susceptibility measurements; hence no novel in vitro antiretroviral susceptibility data are reported.

Answer: No

Answer: No


Question: 2103 

Evidence: Plasma was collected in Santo Domingo at the time of entry into the study and sent in batches several times yearly to the reference laboratory for genotype testing and subtype analysis using the GeneSeq HIV assay. Of the 103 samples sequenced, all were classified as subtype B.

Answer: 0


Question: 2605 

Evidence: The median baseline CD4+ count was 216 cells/μl. Among the 49 patients with available baseline HIV-1 plasma RNA levels, the median was 59,604 copies/ml.

Rationale: Detectable plasma HIV-1 RNA indicates ongoing viral replication in these untreated individuals.

Answer: Yes


Question: 2606 

Evidence: Plasma was collected in Santo Domingo at the time of entry into the study and sent ... for genotype testing. This assay reports population-based amino acid coding sequences from ... reverse transcriptase (RT) and ... protease (PR).

Rationale: Sequencing was conducted on plasma RNA, not on proviral DNA, so sequences were not obtained from the proviral DNA reservoir.

Rationale: This was an observational cohort, not a randomized interventional clinical trial.

Answer: No


Question: 2703 

Evidence: Patients were selected for inclusion in the study as they enrolled in a prospective, observational cohort study. Physicians and patient educators ... offered enrollment to all individuals initiating ART.

Rationale: Because it was an observational cohort and not a clinical trial, not all individuals were in a clinical trial.

Answer: No

Rationale: Integrase inhibitors are not mentioned as part of the program regimens or the study, so the paper does not report individuals receiving integrase inhibitors.

Answer: No


Question: 4303 

Evidence: Patients were excluded if they had previously taken antiretroviral therapy, except as above. The national antiretroviral program has adopted ... second-line (NRTI+PI) regimens.

Answer: No


Question: 4304 

Evidence: Patients were included if they ... planned to initiate antiretroviral therapy. Genotype testing was successfully performed on 103 treatment-naive adults.

Rationale: The study focuses on baseline (pre-ART) genotyping; it does not report administered ART regimens for these participants, so there is no basis to assert all received the same ART.

Answer: NA


Question: 4305 

Evidence: The national antiretroviral program has adopted ... first-line (NRTI+NNRTI) and second-line (NRTI+PI) regimens. Genotype testing was successfully performed on 103 treatment-naive adults planning to initiate antiretroviral therapy.

Rationale: Integrase inhibitors are not part of the described regimens and participants were ART-naive; therefore, they were INSTI-naive.

Answer: Yes


Question: 4403 

Evidence: Patients were included if they ... planned to initiate antiretroviral therapy. Genotype testing was successfully performed on 103 treatment-naive adults.

Rationale: The study reports pre-ART genotyping and does not provide data on ART regimens received; thus, the number receiving more than one regimen cannot be determined.

Answer: NA


Question: 4404 

Evidence: Patients were included if they ... planned to initiate antiretroviral therapy. Genotype testing was successfully performed on 103 treatment-naive adults.

Rationale: No treatment course data are provided; hence, it is not possible to determine how many received more than two ART regimens.

Answer: NA


Question: 4405 

Evidence: Patients were included if they ... planned to initiate antiretroviral therapy. Genotype testing was successfully performed on 103 treatment-naive adults.

Rationale: The paper does not report ART regimens actually received; therefore, it cannot be determined whether all received the same number of regimens.

Answer: NA


Question: 4406 

Evidence: Patients were included if they ... planned to initiate antiretroviral therapy. Genotype testing was successfully performed on 103 treatment-naive adults.

Rationale: The study reports only baseline (pre-ART) genotyping and no treatment administration data; thus, it cannot be determined how many received one ART regimen.

Answer: NA


Question: 4501 

Evidence: The national antiretroviral program has adopted ... first-line (NRTI+NNRTI) and second-line (NRTI+PI) regimens. Genotype testing was successfully performed on 103 treatment-naive adults planning to initiate antiretroviral therapy.

Rationale: Integrase inhibitors such as dolutegravir are not mentioned, and participants were ART-naive at baseline; no individuals received dolutegravir in this report.

Answer: 0


Question: 4502 

Evidence: The national antiretroviral program has adopted ... second-line (NRTI+PI) regimens. Patients were included if they ... planned to initiate antiretroviral therapy.

Rationale: The paper does not report any administered ART regimens, and participants were ART-naive at baseline; consequently, none are reported to have received darunavir.

Answer: 0

Rationale: Eight individuals had one or more WHO surveillance drug resistance mutations.

Answer: 8


Question: 5102 

Evidence: This assay reports population-based amino acid coding sequences ... for the reverse transcriptase (RT) and ... for the protease (PR). No WHO SDRMs for protease inhibitors were identified.

Rationale: Integrase was not sequenced and INSTI resistance was not assessed; therefore, the number with INSTI-resistance mutations cannot be determined from this paper.

Answer: NA


Question: 5103 

Evidence: The only NRTI mutation identified was M184M/V. Nonpolymorphic nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)-associated DRMs ... were found in one (1.0%) sample, respectively.
