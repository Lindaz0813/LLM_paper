Answer: No


Question: 3101 

Evidence: HIV viral load was performed and unsuppressed participants (VL > 1000 copies/mL) had genotyping performed by Sanger sequencing. Among the 11 patients with unsuppressed viremia (PVL ≥ 1000 copies/mL), HIV-1 integrase genotyping was successful for 72.7% (8/11)...

Rationale: Sequencing was done after at least six months of ART, not in ART-naive individuals.

Answer: No


Question: 4102 

Evidence: Through an exhaustive sampling strategy, two groups of patients were recruited: (i) those initiating ART directly with TLD (I-TLD), and (ii) those transitioning from TLE or TLN to TLD (T-TLD). Among the 11 patients with unsuppressed viremia (PVL ≥ 1000 copies/mL), HIV-1 integrase genotyping was successful for 72.7% (8/11)...

Rationale: All sequenced individuals were on ART (TLD), including some with prior NNRTI-based ART (TLE), thus previously treated.

Answer: Yes


Question: 4103

Rationale: The inclusion/exclusion criteria ensured clear ART history (I-TLD vs T-TLD) for all included participants.

Answer: Yes


Question: 4201 

Evidence: As per national guidelines, viral load and NRTI resistance were not performed at treatment initiation, which could have helped to mitigate potential effects of baseline viremia and/or preexisting drug resistance mutations on the current TLD efficacy in both groups. Among the 11 patients with unsuppressed viremia (PVL ≥ 1000 copies/mL), HIV-1 integrase genotyping was successful for 72.7% (8/11)...

Rationale: No baseline sequencing in untreated individuals was performed; therefore, transmitted resistance prevalence was not assessed.

Answer: No


Question: 4202 

Evidence: As per national guidelines, viral load and NRTI resistance were not performed at treatment initiation, which could have helped to mitigate potential effects of baseline viremia and/or preexisting drug resistance mutations on the current TLD efficacy in both groups. Among the 11 patients with unsuppressed viremia (PVL ≥ 1000 copies/mL), HIV-1 integrase genotyping was successful...

Rationale: Pretreatment resistance prevalence requires baseline testing prior to ART; the study did not perform such testing.

Answer: No


Question: 4301 

Evidence: DTG is an integrase strand-transfer inhibitor (INSTI) with a high potency, a high genetic barrier to HIV drug resistance, and is widely available in a fixed-dose combination consisting of tenofovir (TDF) + lamivudine (3TC) + DTG (TLD). Therefore, TLD is the current preferred regimen for ART initiation in RLS in replacement of tenofovir (TDF) + lamivudine (3TC) + EFV (TLE).

Rationale: Participants received NRTIs (TDF, 3TC), an INSTI (DTG), and some previously received an NNRTI (EFV).

Question: 4303 

Evidence: current guidelines recommend a switch to second-line regimens consisting of two NRTIs and one ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (PI/r) in the event of first-line ART failures. Out of 12,093 patients receiving ART at the reference treatment centres (YCH and DGH), 310 had been on a DTG-based first-line ART for at least six months.

Rationale: The study cohort consisted of first-line DTG-based regimens; no participants are reported as receiving PI/r.

Answer: No


Question: 4304

Rationale: At the time of study, all participants were receiving the same regimen (TLD).

Answer: Yes


Question: 4305 

Evidence: two groups of patients were recruited: (i) those initiating ART directly with TLD (I-TLD), and (ii) those transitioning from TLE ... to TLD (T-TLD). DTG is an integrase strand-transfer inhibitor (INSTI)...

Rationale: Prior to receiving TLD, participants had not received INSTIs (they either started with TLD or came from EFV-based TLE), indicating INSTI-naive status before TLD.

Answer: Yes


Question: 4403 

Evidence: 171/310 (55.16%) participants initiated ART directly with TLD (I-TLD) and the remaining 139/310 (44.84%), initiated ART with TLE before subsequent transition to TLD (T-TLD). We did not find any participant transitioning from TLN to TLD.

Rationale: The T-TLD group received two regimens (TLE then TLD); thus, 139 individuals received more than one regimen.

Answer: 139


Question: 4404 

Evidence: 171/310 ... initiated ART directly with TLD ... and 139/310 ... initiated ART with TLE before subsequent transition to TLD (T-TLD). We did not find any participant transitioning from TLN to TLD.

Rationale: Only two regimens are described; there is no indication anyone received more than two.

Answer: 0


Question: 4405 

Evidence: 171/310 ... initiated ART directly with TLD (I-TLD) and the remaining 139/310 ... initiated ART with TLE before subsequent transition to TLD (T-TLD). 

Rationale: Some individuals had one regimen (I-TLD) and others had two (T-TLD); therefore, not all had the same number of regimens.

Answer: No


Question: 4406 

Evidence: 171/310 ... initiated ART directly with TLD (I-TLD) and the remaining 139/310 ... initiated ART with TLE before subsequent transition to TLD (T-TLD). 

Rationale: Because 139 participants had two regimens, not all received only one regimen.

Answer: No


Question: 4501 

Evidence: Out of 12,093 patients receiving ART at the reference treatment centres (YCH and DGH), 310 had been on a DTG-based first-line ART for at least six months. Eligible participants were HIV-1 infected patients currently under TLD first-line ART...

Rationale: All 310 participants were on dolutegravir-containing TLD.

Answer: 310


Question: 4502 

Evidence: current guidelines recommend a switch to second-line regimens consisting of two NRTIs and one ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (PI/r) in the event of first-line ART failures. Out of 12,093 patients receiving ART..., 310 had been on a DTG-based first-line ART for at least six months.

Rationale: The cohort consisted of first-line DTG-based therapy; no protease inhibitor such as darunavir is reported as used.

Answer: 0


Question: 5101 

Evidence: HIV-1 integrase genotyping was successful for 72.7% (8/11) of the study participants. No major mutations to integrase inhibitors were found.

Rationale: Among sequenced individuals, no integrase inhibitor resistance mutations meeting their resistance definition were detected; no other genes were sequenced for resistance.

Answer: 0


Question: 5102 

Evidence: No major mutations to integrase inhibitors were found. All variants at amino acid positions associated with a decreased INSTI susceptibility (i.e., at least a Stanford penalty score ≥ 10) were considered as resistant variants.

Rationale: Using their resistance definition, none of the sequenced samples had INSTI-resistance mutations.

Answer: 0


Question: 5103 

Evidence: As per national guidelines, viral load and NRTI resistance were not performed at treatment initiation... Regarding the analysis of drug-resistance mutations (DRMs), sequences ... were analyzed ... for interpreting DRMs by using Stanford HIVdb v9 [integrase].

Rationale: The study did not report RT/NRTI genotyping results; therefore, the presence of TDF-resistance mutations cannot be determined.

Answer: NA


Question: 5104 

Evidence: No major mutations to integrase inhibitors were found. 

Rationale: Since no INSTI resistance mutations were detected, there are none to list.

Answer: None
