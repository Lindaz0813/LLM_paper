---

**Question: 1102**

Answer: Yes

---

**Question: 1103**

Evidence: NA

Rationale: The paper describes *in vitro* assays to measure viral replicative capacity (VRC) of chimeric viruses, but it does not describe any experiments involving the serial passage of viruses in cell culture to select for variants, which is the definition of an *in vitro* passage experiment.

Answer: No

---

**Question: 1104**

Evidence: NA

Rationale: A thorough reading of the paper's abstract, results, and methods sections reveals no mention of testing virus susceptibility to any antiretroviral drugs. The study focuses on replication capacity and sequence variation, not drug susceptibility.

**Question: 2102**

Evidence: The Gag-Pol sequences described here have been deposited in GenBank with the accession numbers MT027065-MT027082, MW316895-MW316901, MW316906-MW316908, MW316914, MW316916, MW316920 and MW316924.

Rationale: The sequences deposited are from patient-derived viruses from Uganda, not from established laboratory HIV isolates like NL4-3 or HXB2. The NL4-3 backbone was used to create chimeras, but the sequenced and deposited Gag-Pol regions are from clinical isolates.

Answer: Yes

**Question: 2202**

Evidence: NA

Rationale: While the paper discusses specific amino acid changes in the Gag-p6 region (e.g., proline to leucine) in the context of replication capacity, it does not provide lists of mutations for each individual sequenced HIV isolate. The analysis is presented in aggregate (e.g., "seven of the eight low VRC sequences have a proline at this site").

Answer: No

---

**Question: 2301**

Evidence: The ability to efficiently establish a new infection is a critical property for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1).

Answer: HIV-1

---

**Question: 2302**

**Question: 3102**

Evidence: Thirty-two Ugandan protocol C participants had sequences successfully cloned... This study utilized protocol C stored plasma samples from 60 participants within 90 days post-EDI.

Rationale: The study started with samples from 60 participants, but only 32 had sequences successfully cloned and characterized. Therefore, not all individuals underwent successful HIV sequencing for this analysis.
