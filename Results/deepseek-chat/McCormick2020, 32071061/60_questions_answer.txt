Question: 1101

Evidence: The donor-derived sample set used in this analysis has been described previously ( 30 , 31 ). All full-length RT sequences that were derived from the 112 subtype C HIV-1 isolates have been deposited in GenBank under the accession numbers MT109380 to MT109491.

Rationale: The paper states that the sample set has been described previously, indicating that the data itself is not entirely new. However, it also mentions that the specific sequences generated for this study have been deposited in GenBank with new accession numbers, which constitutes previously unpublished data.

Answer: Yes

Question: 2202

Evidence: NNRTI and NRTI drug resistance mutations from the 100 donor-derived recombinant viruses were analyzed to determine if specific mutations were associated with resistance to ETR. After adjustment for multiple comparisons, L100I (q \< 0.049), Y181C (q \< 0.001), and M230L (q \< 0.174) were the only NNRTI mutations significantly associated with ETR resistance ( Table 1 ).
