**Question: 1101**

**Evidence:** This open-label observational study shows that an etravirine/raltegravir (200/400mg) regimen given twice daily could be safely switched to a once-daily regimen in virally suppressed participants, with a virological success rate of 98.0% at W48. Between September 2017 and June 2018, 113 patients from seven French sites were screened. Two patients did not fulfil inclusion criteria (under etravirine/raltegravir q12h for less than 96 weeks), leaving 111 patients for analysis.

**Rationale:** The paper describes a specific, prospective clinical study conducted between 2017 and 2018, involving patient screening, enrollment, and analysis of outcomes over 48 weeks. This constitutes a report of new, primary research data collected for this study, which would not have been published before.

**Answer: Yes**

**Question: 1102**

**Evidence:** One VF occurred at W24 with two pVL values of 7950 and 5440 copies/mL concomitantly with low plasma C24h of etravirine (99 ng/mL) and adequate C24h of raltegravir (34 ng/mL), leading to the emergence of resistance mutations associated with INSTIs (L74I, G140A and Q148H). Past HIV-RNA genotypes showed a B subtype with the presence of K103N and 100I mutations (in 2000, 2001, 2003 and 2017), which could decrease the etravirine viral potency (2019 ANRS algorithm, v.30). The second VF occurred at W48 with only one pVL value of 156 copies/mL, which led to ART change, with concomitant adequate plasma C24h for etravirine (367 ng/mL) and raltegravir (102 ng/mL) and no emergence of resistance. Past HIV-RNA genotypes displayed an A1 subtype with several NNRTI-associated resistance mutations (A98G, K101R and G190E/Q), which may reduce the viral potency of etravirine (2019 ANRS algorithm, v.30).

**Rationale:** The paper explicitly mentions "HIV-RNA genotypes" performed in the past for the two patients who experienced virological failure. It reports the specific mutations found in these genotypes (e.g., K103N, 100I, A98G, K101R, G190E/Q, L74I, G140A, Q148H). Reporting the results of genotypic analysis, which is based on sequencing the HIV virus, qualifies as reporting HIV sequences.

**Answer: Yes**

---

**Question: 1103**

**Evidence:** The paper content does not contain any mention of in vitro passage experiments.

**Rationale:** A thorough review of the entire paper content, including the Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion sections, reveals no description of experiments where HIV was serially passaged in cell culture. The study is a clinical trial focusing on treatment efficacy and pharmacokinetics in human patients.

**Answer: No**

---

**Question: 1104**

**Evidence:** The limit of quantification was 5 ng/mL for both drugs and interpretation was based on the corresponding in vitro protein-adjusted 95% inhibitory concentration (PBIC95) for WT HIV-1: 116 ng/mL for etravirine and 15 ng/mL for raltegravir.

**Rationale:** The paper reports the "in vitro protein-adjusted 95% inhibitory concentration (PBIC95)" for etravirine and raltegravir against wild-type HIV-1. This is a measure of a drug's in vitro antiretroviral susceptibility, indicating the concentration needed to inhibit viral replication by 95% in a laboratory setting.

**Answer: Yes**

---

**Question: 2101**

**Evidence:** The paper content does not contain any GenBank accession numbers.

**Rationale:** A search through the entire paper content finds no mention of "GenBank" or any alphanumeric identifiers that resemble GenBank accession numbers (e.g., starting with KY, MF, etc.). The sequences mentioned are from clinical genotyping, but their specific accession numbers are not provided.

**Answer: No**

---

**Question: 2102**

**Evidence:** The paper content does not contain any GenBank accession numbers.

**Rationale:** Since no GenBank accession numbers are reported at all, there are none for laboratory HIV isolates or any other types of isolates.

**Answer: No**

---

**Question: 2103**

**Evidence:** The paper content does not contain any GenBank accession numbers.

**Rationale:** No GenBank accession numbers are mentioned in the text.

**Answer: NA**

---

**Question: 2202**

**Evidence:** Past HIV-RNA genotypes showed a B subtype with the presence of K103N and 100I mutations (in 2000, 2001, 2003 and 2017), which could decrease the etravirine viral potency (2019 ANRS algorithm, v.30). Past HIV-RNA genotypes displayed an A1 subtype with several NNRTI-associated resistance mutations (A98G, K101R and G190E/Q), which may reduce the viral potency of etravirine (2019 ANRS algorithm, v.30). One VF occurred at W24... leading to the emergence of resistance mutations associated with INSTIs (L74I, G140A and Q148H).

**Rationale:** The paper provides specific lists of mutations (K103N, 100I, A98G, K101R, G190E/Q, L74I, G140A, Q148H) that were identified in the sequenced HIV isolates from the two patients who experienced virological failure. These mutations are reported on an individual basis for each case of failure.

**Answer: Yes**

---

**Question: 2301**

**Evidence:** All HIV-1-infected adults ≥18 years old with HIV-RNA pVL <50 copies/mL under a stable oral dual etravirine/raltegravir therapy q12h for at least 96 weeks were eligible in this prospective cohort study.

**Rationale:** The paper explicitly states that the study population consists of adults infected with "HIV-1". There is no mention of HIV-2 or any other HIV species.

**Answer: HIV-1**

---

**Question: 2302**

**Evidence:** Past HIV-RNA genotypes showed a B subtype with the presence of K103N and 100I mutations. Past HIV-RNA genotypes displayed an A1 subtype with several NNRTI-associated resistance mutations (A98G, K101R and G190E/Q).

**Rationale:** For the two patients for whom sequence data is discussed, the paper specifies the subtypes of their viruses: one is subtype B and the other is subtype A1.

**Answer: B, A1**

---

**Question: 2303**

**Evidence:** Past HIV-RNA genotypes showed a B subtype with the presence of K103N and 100I mutations. leading to the emergence of resistance mutations associated with INSTIs (L74I, G140A and Q148H). Past HIV-RNA genotypes displayed an A1 subtype with several NNRTI-associated resistance mutations (A98G, K101R and G190E/Q).

**Rationale:** The mutations reported (K103N, 100I, A98G, K101R, G190E/Q) are associated with resistance to NNRTIs and are located in the reverse transcriptase (RT) gene. The mutations L74I, G140A, and Q148H are associated with INSTI resistance and are located in the integrase (IN) gene. Therefore, the paper reports sequences from at least the RT and IN genes.

**Answer: Reverse transcriptase (RT), Integrase (IN)**

---

**Question: 2304**

**Evidence:** One VF occurred at W24... leading to the emergence of resistance mutations associated with INSTIs (L74I, G140A and Q148H).

**Rationale:** The paper reports specific integrase resistance mutations (L74I, G140A, Q148H) that emerged in one patient. This indicates that HIV pol sequences, specifically the integrase region of the pol gene, were obtained and analyzed.

**Answer: Yes**

---

**Question: 2401**

**Evidence:** Between September 2017 and June 2018, 113 patients from seven French sites were screened. Two patients did not fulfil inclusion criteria (under etravirine/raltegravir q12h for less than 96 weeks), leaving 111 patients for analysis.

**Rationale:** The study was conducted at seven clinical sites in France, and all 111 analyzed patients were from these sites. Therefore, the sequences discussed are from France.

**Answer: France**

---

**Question: 2402**

**Evidence:** Past HIV-RNA genotypes showed a B subtype with the presence of K103N and 100I mutations (in 2000, 2001, 2003 and 2017). Blood samples for pharmacological analysis were collected during the study period 24 ± 2 h after the last drug intake ( C24h ) in a subgroup of patients. Between September 2017 and June 2012018, 113 patients from seven French sites were screened.

**Rationale:** The paper refers to "past" genotypes with years listed (2000, 2001, 2003, 2017). The main study, during which new virological failure occurred, was conducted between 2017 and 2018, with follow-up to 48 weeks. The samples for the new failure cases with emergent INSTI mutations would have been obtained in 2017-2018.

**Answer: 2000, 2001, 2003, 2017, 2017-2018**

---

**Question: 2502**

**Evidence:** The paper content does not specify the sequencing method used.

**Rationale:** While the paper reports the results of genotypic resistance testing, it does not explicitly state the technology used (e.g., Sanger sequencing, NGS). It is common practice in clinical settings to use Sanger sequencing for resistance genotyping, but this is not confirmed in the text.

**Answer: NA**

---

**Question: 2503**

**Evidence:** The paper content does not specify the sequencing method used.

**Rationale:** The method used for HIV sequencing is not described in the provided text.

**Answer: NA**

---

**Question: 2504**

**Evidence:** The paper content does not mention any cloning of samples prior to sequencing.

**Rationale:** There is no reference to molecular cloning or any cloning process in the methodology or results sections.

**Answer: No**

---

**Question: 2505**

**Evidence:** The paper content does not mention single genome sequencing.

**Rationale:** The sequencing methodology is not detailed, and single genome sequencing is not referred to anywhere in the text.

**Answer: No**

---

**Question: 2506**

**Evidence:** The paper content does not mention molecular cloning.

**Rationale:** There is no description of molecular cloning being used on any samples in the study.

**Answer: No**

---

**Question: 2601**

**Evidence:** One VF occurred at W24 with two pVL values of 7950 and 5440 copies/mL. The second VF occurred at W48 with only one pVL value of 156 copies/mL.

**Rationale:** The paper describes virological failure based on plasma viral load (pVL) measurements and the emergence of resistance mutations in one case. This implies that sequencing was performed on virus from plasma samples to detect these mutations.

**Answer: Yes**

---

**Question: 2602**

**Evidence:** The paper content does not mention sequencing from PBMCs.

**Rationale:** The text only discusses plasma viral load (pVL) and genotypes in the context of virological failure in plasma. There is no mention of sequencing proviral DNA from PBMCs.

**Answer: No**

---

**Question: 2603**

**Evidence:** One VF occurred at W24 with two pVL values of 7950 and 5440 copies/mL. The second VF occurred at W48 with only one pVL value of 156 copies/mL.

**Rationale:** The paper reports sequencing results for two patients who experienced virological failure, based on their elevated plasma viral loads. Therefore, at least two samples underwent plasma virus sequencing.

**Answer: 2**

---

**Question: 2604**

**Evidence:** The paper content does not mention sequencing from PBMCs.

**Rationale:** No information is provided about PBMC virus sequencing.

**Answer: 0**

---

**Question: 2605**

**Evidence:** One VF occurred at W24 with two pVL values of 7950 and 5440 copies/mL. The second VF occurred at W48 with only one pVL value of 156 copies/mL.

**Rationale:** The sequences reported (showing emergent INSTI mutations) were obtained from patients at the time of virological failure, when they had detectable plasma viral loads (7950, 5440, and 156 copies/mL). This indicates active HIV replication at the time of sampling.

**Answer: Yes**

---

**Question: 2606**

**Evidence:** The paper content does not mention sequencing from proviral DNA.

**Rationale:** The sequencing discussed is in the context of plasma viral rebound (RNA), not the latent proviral DNA reservoir.

**Answer: No**

---

**Question: 2701**

**Evidence:** All HIV-1-infected adults ≥18 years old with HIV-RNA pVL <50 copies/mL under a stable oral dual etravirine/raltegravir therapy q12h for at least 96 weeks were eligible in this prospective cohort study.

**Rationale:** The eligibility criteria specify "adults ≥18 years old". There is no mention of infants, children, or adolescents in the study population.

**Answer: No**

---

**Question: 2702**

**Evidence:** Patients on a suppressive etravirine/raltegravir q12h regimen for at least 96 weeks were switched to etravirine/raltegravir q24h in this prospective, multicentre, open-label, single-arm study.

**Rationale:** The paper describes a specific, prospective, open-label, single-arm study with defined endpoints and methodology. This fits the definition of a clinical trial.

**Answer: Yes**

---

**Question: 2703**

**Evidence:** A total of 111 patients were enrolled.

**Rationale:** The paper describes a single study cohort of 111 enrolled patients. All individuals mentioned in the results are part of this clinical trial.

**Answer: Yes**

---

**Question: 3101**

**Evidence:** One VF occurred at W24 with two pVL values of 7950 and 5440 copies/mL. The second VF occurred at W48 with only one pVL value of 156 copies/mL.

**Rationale:** Sequencing was performed on samples from the two individuals who experienced virological failure. The paper does not indicate that sequencing was performed on all 111 individuals, only on those who failed treatment.

**Answer: 2**

---

**Question: 3102**

**Evidence:** The paper content does not state that all individuals underwent sequencing.

**Rationale:** The results only discuss sequencing in the context of the two virological failures. It can be inferred that sequencing was not routine for all patients, but only triggered by virological failure.

**Answer: No**

---

**Question: 4101**

**Evidence:** They were virologically suppressed on ART for a median duration of 7.9 years (IQR 5.9–10.7). The median duration of raltegravir/etravirine q12h was 29 months (IQR 26–40).

**Rationale:** All participants in the study had been on antiretroviral therapy (ART) for a median of 7.9 years and were switching from a previous etravirine/raltegravir regimen. This confirms that none of the individuals were ART-naive.

**Answer: No**

---

**Question: 4102**

**Evidence:** They were virologically suppressed on ART for a median duration of 7.9 years (IQR 5.9–10.7). The median duration of raltegravir/etravirine q12h was 29 months (IQR 26–40).

**Rationale:** The entire study population consisted of individuals who had been receiving ART for a long time and were switching from a previous regimen, making them all ART-experienced.

**Answer: Yes**

---

**Question: 4103**

**Evidence:** They were virologically suppressed on ART for a median duration of 7.9 years (IQR 5.9–10.7).

**Rationale:** The paper explicitly states that all participants were virologically suppressed on ART, meaning all were ART-experienced. There is no mention of any ART-naive individuals.

**Answer: No**

---

**Question: 4104**

**Evidence:** The paper content does not mention any ART-naive individuals.

**Rationale:** As established, all participants were ART-experienced.

**Answer: 0**

---

**Question: 4105**

**Evidence:** The paper content does not provide a complete ART history for each individual.

**Rationale:** While the paper gives summary statistics for the population (e.g., median duration of suppression, duration on previous regimen), it does not provide a detailed, complete ART history for each of the 111 individuals.

**Answer: No**

---

**Question: 4201**

**Evidence:** The paper content does not discuss transmitted drug resistance.

**Rationale:** The study focuses on virological failure in a treatment-experienced population switching regimens. It does not investigate the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance in a naive population.

**Answer: No**

---

**Question: 4202**

**Evidence:** The paper content does not discuss pretreatment drug resistance in a cohort starting a new regimen.

**Rationale:** The study participants were already suppressed on a regimen before switching. The paper discusses past resistance in the context of failure, not the prevalence of pretreatment resistance at the start of the study's q24h regimen.

**Answer: No**

---

**Question: 4301**

**Evidence:** Etravirine/raltegravir dual therapy has been shown to be highly effective as a twice-daily (q12h) regimen. We selected etravirine as it was, at that time, the only second-generation NNRTI to be the companion drug to raltegravir.

**Rationale:** The paper specifically studies a dual therapy regimen consisting of etravirine (an NNRTI) and raltegravir (an INSTI). These are the two drug classes received by all individuals in the study.

**Answer: Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), Integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI)**

---

**Question: 4302**

**Evidence:** Etravirine/raltegravir dual therapy has been shown to be highly effective. Patients on a suppressive etravirine/raltegravir q12h regimen for at least 96 weeks were switched to etravirine/raltegravir q24h.

**Rationale:** Raltegravir is an integrase inhibitor (INSTI), and all individuals in the study were receiving it as part of their dual therapy regimen, both before and after the switch.

**Answer: Yes**

---

**Question: **Question: 4303**

**Evidence:** The benefit of the etravirine/raltegravir combination in an ageing population has been shown in the ANRS-163 ETRAL study.5 Especially, the participants had improved their lipid profile and their bone mineral density after stopping boosted PIs and tenofovir, which could avoid cardiovascular and bone fracture risks.

**Rationale:** The paper mentions that participants in the prior ANRS-163 study had stopped boosted Protease Inhibitors (PIs) before starting the etravirine/raltegravir regimen. This implies that the individuals in the current study had a history of receiving PIs in the past. However, during the current study period, they were not receiving PIs as part of their regimen.

**Answer: Yes (historically, but not during the reported study)**

---

**Question: 4304**

**Evidence:** Patients on a suppressive etravirine/raltegravir q12h regimen for at least 96 weeks were switched to etravirine/raltegravir q24h in this prospective, multicentre, open-label, single-arm study.

**Rationale:** All 111 patients in the study were switched from the same twice-daily etravirine/raltegravir regimen to the same once-daily etravirine/raltegravir regimen. Therefore, all individuals received the same ART during the study period.

**Answer: Yes**

---

**Question: 4305**

**Evidence:** The median duration of raltegravir/etravirine q12h was 29 months (IQR 26–40). Patients on a suppressive etravirine/raltegravir q12h regimen for at least 96 weeks were switched to etravirine/raltegravir q24h.

**Rationale:** All patients had been on a raltegravir-containing regimen (an INSTI) for a median of over two years prior to switching in this study. Therefore, none of the individuals were INSTI-naive.

**Answer: No**

---

**Question: 4403**

**Evidence:** The paper content does not provide the specific number of individuals who received more than one ART regimen.

**Rationale:** While it is highly likely that these treatment-experienced patients had received multiple regimens in their lifetime, the paper does not provide a count or summary statistic for this specific detail.

**Answer: NA**

---

**Question: 4404**

**Evidence:** The paper content does not provide the specific number of individuals who received more than two ART regimens.

**Rationale:** The number of prior ART regimens per individual is not reported in the paper.

**Answer: NA**

---

**Question: 4405**

**Evidence:** The paper content does not provide information on whether all individuals received the same number of ART regimens.

**Rationale:** The paper does not compare or state the number of prior ART regimens for the participants.

**Answer: NA**

---

**Question: 4406**

**Evidence:** They were virologically suppressed on ART for a median duration of 7.9 years (IQR 5.9–10.7).

**Rationale:** Given the long median duration of ART (7.9 years), it is virtually impossible that all individuals had only received one ART regimen in their lifetime. The paper does not state this, and the context strongly suggests otherwise.

**Answer: No**

---

**Question: 4501**

**Evidence:** The paper content does not mention any individual receiving dolutegravir during the study.

**Rationale:** Dolutegravir is mentioned in the introduction and discussion as a comparator drug in other studies, but it is not listed as part of the regimen for any patient in this specific study. One patient who failed was resuppressed on a regimen *including* dolutegravir, but this was after the study's treatment failure.

**Answer: 0**

---

**Question: 4502**

**Evidence:** The patient was resuppressed under a dual therapy combining etravirine (400 mg q24h) and darunavir/ritonavir (800/100 mg q24h).

**Rationale:** One patient who experienced virological failure was subsequently treated with a regimen containing darunavir. However, this was not the regimen they received as part of the study intervention. During the study itself, no patient received darunavir.

**Answer: 0**

---

**Question: 5101**

**Evidence:** One VF occurred at W24... leading to the emergence of resistance mutations associated with INSTIs (L74I, G140A and Q148H). Past HIV-RNA genotypes showed a B subtype with the presence of K103N and 100I mutations. Past HIV-RNA genotypes displayed an A1 subtype with several NNRTI-associated resistance mutations (A98G, K101R and G190E/Q).

**Rationale:** Two individuals were found to have drug resistance mutations. One had both past NNRTI mutations and newly emergent INSTI mutations. The other had past NNRTI mutations but no emergent resistance upon failure. Therefore, two individuals had one or more drug resistance mutation.

**Answer: 2**

---

**Question: 5102**

**Evidence:** One VF occurred at W24... leading to the emergence of resistance mutations associated with INSTIs (L74I, G140A and Q148H).

**Rationale:** Only one patient developed new INSTI-resistance mutations during the study.

**Answer: 1**

---

**Question: 5103**

**Evidence:** The paper content does not mention TDF (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) or any TDF-resistance mutations.

**Rationale:** A search for "TDF", "tenofovir", or associated mutations (e.g., K65R) yields no results in the provided text.

**Answer: 0**

---

**Question: 5104**

**Evidence:** One VF occurred at W24... leading to the emergence of resistance mutations associated with INSTIs (L74I, G140A and Q148H).

**Rationale:** The paper explicitly lists the INSTI-resistance mutations that emerged in one patient during virological failure.

**Answer: L74I, G140A, Q148H**

---

**Question: 6101**

**Evidence:** The paper content does not describe any phenotypic susceptibility tests being performed.

**Rationale:** The resistance analysis mentioned is genotypic (identifying mutations), not phenotypic (measuring drug concentration needed to inhibit virus in a cell culture assay). The "PBIC95" values cited are reference values from the literature, not results from tests performed in this study.

**Answer: NA**

---

**Question: 6102**

**Evidence:** The paper content does not report IC50 or IC90 values from experiments.

**Rationale:** The pharmacological data reported are plasma drug concentrations (C24h), not inhibitory concentration (IC) values from susceptibility assays.

**Answer: No**

---

**Question: 6103**

**Evidence:** The paper content does not report IC50 fold change values.

**Rationale:** No fold change values, which are a common output of phenotypic susceptibility assays, are reported.

**Answer: No**

---

**Question: 6104**

**Evidence:** The paper content does not mention which phenotypic susceptibility assay was used.

**Rationale:** Since no phenotypic susceptibility testing was reported, no assay is named.

**Answer: NA**

---

**Question: 6105**

**Evidence:** The paper content does not report data about replication capacity.

**Rationale:** There is no mention of replication capacity or fitness assays for any viral isolates.

**Answer: No**

---

**Question: 6106**

**Evidence:** The paper content does not report results of phenotypic susceptibility testing for any drugs.

**Rationale:** As no phenotypic testing was performed, no drugs were tested using this method.

**Answer: NA**

---

**Question: 7101**

**Evidence:** The paper content does not describe any site-directed mutagenesis experiments.

**Rationale:** All viruses discussed were isolated from patients in a clinical trial. There is no mention of engineered viruses created through site-directed mutagenesis.

**Answer: No**

---

**Question: 7102**

**Evidence:** The paper content does not contain any mention of in vitro passage experiments.

**Rationale:** As established for question 1103, the paper does not describe any experiments involving the passage of virus in cell culture. All viral data comes directly from patient samples.

**Answer: No**
