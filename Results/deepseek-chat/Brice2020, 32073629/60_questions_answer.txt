Question: 1101 

Evidence: This cross-sectional study, conducted within a prospective cohort, included ART-treated VHIV children followed at Gabriel Touré Hospital (Bamako, Mali) with sustained virological suppression (plasma HIV-1 RNA ≤50 copies/mL) for at least 6 months. From August 2013 to April 2014, 97 VHIV HAART-treated children with virological suppression were enrolled; resistance testing was available for 93 children (96%).

Answer: Yes

---

Question: 1102 

Evidence: Bulk sequences of the RT and protease genes in DNA were determined on DBSs using the French Agency for HIV Research and Hepatitis (ANRS) sequencing method described at http://www.hivfrenchresistance.org . Consensus sequences were aligned and edited using SmartGene HIV software (Innovation Park, Lausanne, Switzerland).

Rationale: The paper explicitly states that they performed sequencing of the Reverse Transcriptase (RT) and protease genes from HIV DNA, which means they generated and reported HIV sequences.

Answer: Yes

---

Question: 1103

Answer: No

---

Question: 2301 

Evidence: The paper exclusively studies HIV-1, as indicated by terms like "HIV-1 RNA" and "HIV-1 DNA" throughout the text.

Question: 2502 

Evidence: Bulk sequences of the RT and protease genes in DNA were determined on DBSs using the French Agency for HIV Research and Hepatitis (ANRS) sequencing method.

Answer: 93

---

Question: 2605 

Evidence: Included ART-treated VHIV children followed at Gabriel Touré Hospital (Bamako, Mali) with sustained virological suppression (plasma HIV-1 RNA ≤50 copies/mL) for at least 6 months.

Rationale: All study participants had suppressed viral loads at the time of sampling, meaning they did not have active HIV replication.

Answer: No

---

Question: 2606 

Evidence: Bulk sequences of the RT and protease genes in DNA were determined on DBSs. Proviral HIV-1 reservoirs are established early during infection and are a source of reactivable virus and archived drug-resistant virus.

Rationale: As all participants were ART-treated, there is no group of ART-naive individuals for comparison.

Answer: No

---

Question: 4104 

Evidence: The paper does not report sequences from ART-naive individuals.

Rationale: Since all participants were on ART, the number of samples from ART-naive individuals is zero.

Answer: 0

---

Question: 4105 

Evidence: The paper provides details on the ART regimens participants were on at the time of the study and their historical ARV exposure frequencies, but it notes a limitation: "we did not know the exact duration of virological suppression" and "we did not know either the exact time of infection... or the prophylaxis and postpartum maternal ARV".

Answer: Yes

---

Question: 4304 

Evidence: 57% of the children were on first-line treatment and the others at least on second-line treatment. The paper lists multiple different ART regimens.

Rationale: The results show that participants were on different lines of therapy and various drug combinations, so they did not all receive the same ART.

Answer: No

---

Question: 4305 

Evidence: The paper does not mention integrase inhibitors in the context of the study participants' treatment.

Rationale: There is no information suggesting that any participant received an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI). The ARV exposure list includes only NRTIs, NNRTIs, and PIs.

Answer: Yes

---

Question: 4403 

Evidence: 57% of the children were on first-line treatment and the others at least on second-line treatment.

Rationale: The phrase "at least on second-line treatment" implies that these children had received more than one ART regimen.

Answer: 40 (43% of 93)

---

Question: 4404 

Evidence: The paper does not specify how many individuals received more than two ART regimens.

Rationale: The data distinguishes between first-line and second-line (or more) treatment but does not specify if any were on a third-line regimen.

Answer: NA

---

Question: 4405 

Evidence: 57% of the children were on first-line treatment and the others at least on second-line treatment.

Rationale: The data shows that participants were on different lines of therapy, meaning they did not all receive the same number of ART regimens.

Answer: No

---

Question: 4406 

Evidence: 57% of the children were on first-line treatment and the others at least on second-line treatment.

Rationale: Since 43% of the children were on at least a second-line regimen, not all individuals received only one ART regimen.

Answer: No

---

Question: 4501 

Evidence: The paper does not mention dolutegravir in the context of the study participants' treatment.

Rationale: Dolutegravir is mentioned in the introduction regarding future guidelines, but it is not listed among the ARVs the participants were exposed to.

Answer: 0

---

Question: 4502 

Evidence: The paper does not mention darunavir in the context of the study participants' treatment.

Answer: 31

---

Question: 5102 

Evidence: The paper does not report INSTI-resistance mutations.

Rationale: The study sequenced only the RT and protease genes. The integrase gene was not sequenced, so no INSTI-resistance mutations could be reported.

Answer: 0

---

Question: 5103 

Evidence: None of the children was exposed to tenofovir.

Rationale: Since no participants received tenofovir (TDF), the study would not report or investigate TDF-resistance mutations.
