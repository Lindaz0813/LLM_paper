Evidence: The paper states that patients were "under first antiretroviral scheme". Table 2 lists the current regimen for each patient, but does not provide history of previous regimens.

Rationale: The inclusion criteria specify that patients were on their *first* antiretroviral scheme, implying they had not yet switched to a second regimen.

Answer: 0

---

**Question: 4404**

Evidence: As patients were on their first ART scheme, they would not have received more than two regimens.

Rationale: The inclusion criteria state that patients were on their first regimen, so the number receiving more than two regimens is zero.

Answer: 0

---

**Question: 4405**

Evidence: "The inclusion criteria were... being under first antiretroviral scheme..."

Rationale: This criterion applied to all enrolled patients, meaning every individual was receiving one, and only one, ART regimen at the time of the study (their first).

Answer: Yes

---

**Question: 4406**

Evidence: "The inclusion criteria were... being under first antiretroviral scheme..."

Rationale: This criterion means that all individuals in the study were, by definition, on their first ART regimen.
