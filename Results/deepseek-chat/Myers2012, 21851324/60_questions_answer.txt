Question: 1101

Evidence: The study’s aim was to determine the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance (TDR) to reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitors in a sample of chronically HIV-1-infected patients in one clinic in Santo Domingo. Genotype testing was successfully performed on 103 treatment-naive adults planning to initiate antiretroviral therapy. To date, there is no published information about HIV resistance from the Dominican Republic.

Rationale: The paper explicitly states that its aim was to determine the prevalence of TDR in a specific sample from Santo Domingo, and that genotype testing was performed on 103 patients. It also notes that there is no previously published information on HIV resistance from the Dominican Republic, confirming that the data being presented are new and previously unpublished.
