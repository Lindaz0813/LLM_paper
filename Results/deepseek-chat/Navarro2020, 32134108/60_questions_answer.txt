Question: 1101

Evidence: This was a multicentre retrospective cohort study conducted in nine tertiary hospitals in Spain. All adult HIV-infected patients who started a once-daily treatment with darunavir 800 mg boosted with either ritonavir 100 mg or cobicistat 150 mg plus rilpivirine 25 mg from January 2015 to January 2019 were included, irrespective of the VL at the moment of initiating this combination.

Rationale: The paper describes a retrospective cohort study conducted from January 2015 to January 2019, analyzing data from patients who received a specific treatment regimen. This indicates the study reports previously collected clinical data rather than data that has been published before.
