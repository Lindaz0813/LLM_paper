"""
Question: 1101

Evidence: A facility-based survey was conducted from June through November 2021 among first-line patients living with HIV (PLWH) initiating ART directly with TLD versus those transitioning from TLE to TLD, all followed at the daycare Hospital of the Yaoundé Central Hospital (YCH) and the Douala General Hospital (DGH), the two main hospitals of the capital cities of Cameroon. Of the 12,093 patients followed, 310 (mean-age: 41 ± 11 years; 52.26% female) complied with study criteria (171 I-TLD vs. 139 T-TLD).

Rationale: The paper describes a specific survey conducted from June to November 2021, involving 310 patients from two hospitals in Cameroon. This indicates the data was collected by the authors for this specific study and is therefore previously unpublished.

Answer: Yes
"""

"""
Question: 1102

Evidence: Among the 11 patients with unsuppressed viremia (PVL ≥ 1000 copies/mL), HIV-1 integrase genotyping was successful for 72.7% (8/11) of the study participants. Two viral strains were identified, 87.5% CRF02_AG (7/8) and 12.5% F2 (1/8).

Rationale: The paper explicitly states that HIV-1 integrase genotyping was performed on samples from 8 patients, and the resulting viral strains (CRF02_AG and F2) were identified. This constitutes the reporting of HIV sequences.

Answer: Yes
"""

"""
Question: 1103

Evidence: The paper does not contain any information or description of in vitro passage experiments.

Rationale: A thorough review of the paper's content, including the methods and results sections, reveals no mention of in vitro passage experiments. The study is based on clinical patient samples.

"""
Question: 1104

Evidence: The paper does not contain any information or data on in vitro antiretroviral susceptibility testing.

Rationale: The methods section describes viral load measurement and genotypic resistance testing, but not phenotypic susceptibility assays. The results report the absence of major drug resistance mutations, but no IC50, IC90, or similar susceptibility data is presented.

Question: 2402

Evidence: The paper does not explicitly state the years during which the samples used for sequencing were obtained.

Rationale: While the survey period (June-November 2021) is given, it is not specified whether the samples sequenced from the 11 unsuppressed patients were collected during this exact period or if they were from earlier time points, especially for the T-TLD group who had been on ART longer.

Question: 4202

Evidence: The paper does not report baseline resistance testing for participants at the time of ART initiation.
