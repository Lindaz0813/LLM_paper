Question: 1101

Evidence: This cross-sectional study included 100 individuals with positive HIV-1 serology, who were older than 18 years of age, under- going antiretroviral therapy for at least six months and pre- senting virologic failure (viral load ≥ 1000 copies/ml of plasma), receiving a medical request for HIV-1 genotyping following the guidelines of the Brazilian Ministry of Health at the time of the study. All individuals were included in the study and had their samples collected between 2018 and 2019..

Rationale: The paper describes a specific study conducted on samples collected between 2018 and 2019, and it provides new GenBank accession numbers for the sequences generated from this study. This indicates the data being reported is original and from their own research, not a re-analysis of previously published data.
