Question: 1101

Evidence: We have enrolled into an observational study (December 1, 2012 to December 31, 2013) patients on long-term salvage regimen with VF on RAL with the aim of establishing if they had developed INSTI resistance, characterize mutations and whether these conferred INSTI cross-resistance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on INSTIs resistance in patients with VF to RAL in Chile.

Rationale: The paper describes an observational study conducted by the authors, presenting results on resistance patterns in Chilean patients. It explicitly states this is the first such report from Chile, indicating the data is new and previously unpublished in this context.
