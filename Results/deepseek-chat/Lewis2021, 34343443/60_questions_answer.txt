Question: 1101 

Evidence: Herein we examine the V3-loop sequences and maraviroc susceptibility of viruses from 704 participants receiving maraviroc in relation to clinical outcome, background regimen antiretroviral activity, and adherence in the MOTIVATE 1 and 2 studies. Week 24 sequence data have previously been submitted to GenBank (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA), accession numbers KT452108 to KT452130, KT452143 to KT452286, KT452311 to KT452358, and KT452383 to KT452526.

Rationale: The paper explicitly states it is examining data from participants in the MOTIVATE 1 and 2 studies, which are clinical trials. It also mentions that Week 24 sequence data have been previously submitted to GenBank, indicating that at least some of the sequence data has been published before. The analysis presented is a retrospective assessment of this clinical trial data.

Answer: No

Question: 1102 

Evidence: Herein we examine the V3-loop sequences and maraviroc susceptibility of viruses from 704 participants receiving maraviroc in relation to clinical outcome, background regimen antiretroviral activity, and adherence in the MOTIVATE 1 and 2 studies. For the retrospective assessment of V3-loop sequences, a database was prepared to associate clinical outcomes from Week 48 with Screening sequence data (Week 48 database). HIV-1 RNA was extracted from frozen plasma samples, and triplicate nested reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction methods were used to amplify and subsequently sequence the V3 loop of gp120 of the HIV-1env encoding region from the RNA extracts, as described by McGovern et al. ^19^

Rationale: The paper's primary focus is on the analysis of V3-loop sequences from HIV-1 viruses. It details the methods used to extract RNA, amplify, and sequence the V3-loop region of the HIV-1 envelope gene (gp120) from plasma samples of study participants.

Answer: Yes

Question: 1103 

Evidence: Two gp120 third variable (V3)–loop amino acid variants, A19T and I26V, confer reduced maraviroc susceptibility in one R5 virus strain (CC1/85) selected during serial in vitro passage.12

Rationale: The paper references a previous study (reference 12) where in vitro passage experiments were performed on a specific virus strain (CC1/85) to select for variants with reduced maraviroc susceptibility. The paper itself does not report conducting new in vitro passage experiments; it is analyzing clinical trial data.

Answer: No

---

Question: 1104 

Evidence: Phenotypic susceptibility to maraviroc was determined with the PhenoSense Entry assay (Monogram Biosciences) and viruses classified as either maraviroc ~sus~ or maraviroc ~res~ based on an MPI cut-off value of 95%. ^20^ Viruses from 15 of 35 maraviroc-treated participants with virologic failure and CCR5-tropic (R5) virus in the MOTIVATE studies at Week 24 had reduced maraviroc susceptibility.

Rationale: The paper explicitly describes using the PhenoSense Entry assay to determine phenotypic susceptibility to maraviroc. It also reports results from this testing, specifically the number of participants whose viruses showed reduced maraviroc susceptibility.

Answer: Yes

Question: 2102 

Evidence: Week 24 sequence data have previously been submitted to GenBank (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA), accession numbers KT452108 to KT452130, KT452143 to KT452286, KT452311 to KT452358, and KT452383 to KT452526. Two gp120 third variable (V3)–loop amino acid variants, A19T and I26V, confer reduced maraviroc susceptibility in one R5 virus strain (CC1/85) selected during serial in vitro passage.12

Rationale: The GenBank accession numbers provided are explicitly for sequences from the Week 24 analysis of participant viruses from the MOTIVATE trials. The paper mentions a laboratory HIV isolate (CC1/85) from a previous study but does not provide GenBank accession numbers for it or any other laboratory isolates.

Answer: Yes

---

Question: 2103 

Evidence: Week 24 sequence data have previously been submitted to GenBank (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA), accession numbers KT452108 to KT452130, KT452143 to KT452286, KT452311 to KT452358, and KT452383 to KT452526.

Rationale: The paper lists the specific GenBank accession numbers for the sequences generated from the Week 24 analysis. The numbers are provided in ranges.

Answer: KT452108 to KT452130, KT452143 to KT452286, KT452311 to KT452358, KT452383 to KT452526

Question: 2202 

Evidence: For the initial participants identified with R5 virologic failure (TLOVR50) and with reduced susceptibility to maraviroc through Week 24, clonal analysis of maraviroc susceptibility and gp160 sequencing was performed on viral isolates obtained at pre- and post-treatment time points (Monogram Biosciences). For each participant, clonal sequences were aligned using a multiple alignment sequence program (MUltiple Sequence Comparison by Log-Expectation), ^21^ and the sequences for the V3-loop region were extracted and compared.

Rationale: The paper describes performing clonal sequencing and analysis for participants at Week 24. This implies that sequences from individual clones were obtained and compared, which would constitute lists of mutations for individual sequenced HIV isolates, even if the full lists are not presented in the main text (they are detailed in a supplementary table).

Answer: Yes

---

Question: 2301 

Evidence: Herein we examine the V3-loop sequences and maraviroc susceptibility of viruses from 704 participants receiving maraviroc... The MOTIVATE dataset was considered to be representative of subtype B viruses.

Answer: Yes

---

Question: 2503 

Evidence: HIV-1 RNA was extracted from frozen plasma samples, and triplicate nested reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction methods were used to amplify and subsequently sequence the V3 loop of gp120 of the HIV-1env encoding region from the RNA extracts.

Rationale: The sequencing method described is a traditional method involving PCR amplification and sequencing, which is characteristic of Sanger sequencing. There is no mention of next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms or techniques.

Answer: No

---

Question: 2504 

Evidence: For the initial participants identified with R5 virologic failure...clonal analysis of maraviroc susceptibility and gp160 sequencing was performed on viral isolates obtained at pre- and post-treatment time points.

Rationale: The paper explicitly states that for the Week 24 analysis, "clonal analysis" was performed. This indicates that the viral population from a sample was cloned prior to sequencing to analyze individual viral variants.

Answer: Yes

---

Question: 2505 

Evidence: For the initial participants identified with R5 virologic failure...clonal analysis of maraviroc susceptibility and gp160 sequencing was performed on viral isolates obtained at pre- and post-treatment time points.

Rationale: The term "clonal analysis" and "clonal sequences" used in the paper refers to sequencing after molecular cloning of the PCR product, which is a method to achieve single genome sequencing. The paper does not use the specific phrase "single genome sequencing" but the process described is functionally equivalent for the purpose of analyzing individual viral genomes.

Answer: Yes

---

Question: 2506 

Evidence: For the initial participants identified with R5 virologic failure...clonal analysis of maraviroc susceptibility and gp160 sequencing was performed on viral isolates obtained at pre- and post-treatment time points.

Rationale: The paper states that out of a larger group of participants who met a virologic outcome, 704 had successful pretreatment V3-loop sequencing. This implies that not all individuals in the broader study underwent successful sequencing, only this subset of 704.

Answer: No

---

Question: 4101 

Evidence: Participants in the MOTIVATE trials were pre-screened for CCR5 tropism... Herein we examine the V3-loop sequences and maraviroc susceptibility of viruses from 704 participants receiving maraviroc.

Rationale: The MOTIVATE studies enrolled treatment-experienced individuals, as they were testing maraviroc as part of an optimized background regimen in people who had failed previous therapy. The paper does not mention any ART-naive participants.

Answer: No

---

Question: 4102 

Evidence: Herein we examine the V3-loop sequences and maraviroc susceptibility of viruses from 704 participants receiving maraviroc in relation to clinical outcome, background regimen antiretroviral activity, and adherence in the MOTIVATE 1 and 2 studies.

Rationale: The MOTIVATE trials were specifically designed for treatment-experienced individuals, as indicated by the term "optimized background regimen" which is used when constructing a new regimen for persons with prior treatment failure.

Answer: Yes

---

Question: 4103 

Evidence: Herein we examine the V3-loop sequences and maraviroc susceptibility of viruses from 704 participants receiving maraviroc in relation to clinical outcome, background regimen antiretroviral activity, and adherence in the MOTIVATE 1 and 2 studies.

Rationale: The paper exclusively reports on sequences from participants in the MOTIVATE trials, which were for treatment-experienced individuals. There is no mention of ART-naive participants.

Answer: No

---

Question: 4104 

Evidence: The paper does not contain any information about ART-naive individuals.

Rationale: The entire study population is described as treatment-experienced. Therefore, the number of samples from ART-naive individuals is zero.

Answer: 0

---

Question: 4105 

Evidence: The paper does not provide complete ART history for each individual.

Rationale: While the paper discusses the optimized background therapy and uses a weighted susceptibility score (pWOBTss) to estimate regimen activity, it does not provide a complete, detailed ART history for each of the 704 individuals.

Answer: No

---

Question: 4201 

Evidence: The paper does not discuss transmitted drug resistance.

Rationale: The study focuses on treatment-experienced individuals and resistance developing during maraviroc therapy. It does not investigate or mention transmitted HIV drug resistance.

Answer: No

---

Question: 4202 

Evidence: The paper does not discuss pretreatment drug resistance in the context of conventional ARV classes.

Rationale: The paper analyzes pretreatment V3-loop sequences for correlates of maraviroc outcome, but it does not report on the prevalence of pretreatment drug resistance to other antiretroviral classes (e.g., NRTIs, NNRTIs, PIs).

Answer: No

---

Question: 4301 

Evidence: A weighted susceptibility score for optimized background therapy obtained using phenotypic activity (pWOBTss) was used to estimate the number of active drugs in each treatment regimen as described previously. ^24^

Rationale: The paper mentions that participants received an "optimized background therapy" regimen, which typically includes drugs from multiple classes. The pWOBTss calculation includes nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). However, it does not provide a specific, exhaustive list of all drug classes received by all individuals.

Answer: NA

---

Question: 4302 

Evidence: The paper does not mention integrase inhibitors.

Rationale: The MOTIVATE trials were...conducted before integrase inhibitors were widely available. The paper focuses on maraviroc, a CCR5 antagonist, and makes no mention of integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) or individuals receiving them.

Answer: No

---

Question: 4303 

Evidence: A weighted susceptibility score for optimized background therapy obtained using phenotypic activity (pWOBTss) was used to estimate the number of active drugs in each treatment regimen as described previously. ^24^

Rationale: The paper mentions "optimized background therapy," which for treatment-experienced patients at the time of the MOTIVATE trials would likely have included protease inhibitors (PIs). The reference for the pWOBTss (24) may detail the drug classes included, but the paper itself does not explicitly list the drug classes received by participants.

Answer: NA

---

Question: 4304 

Evidence: A weighted susceptibility score for optimized background therapy obtained using phenotypic activity (pWOBTss) was used to estimate the number of active drugs in each treatment regimen.

Rationale: The use of a "weighted susceptibility score" implies that the background regimens were not identical for all participants. The score was used to estimate the activity of each individual's unique optimized background regimen.

Answer: No

---

Question: 4305 

Evidence: The paper does not mention integrase inhibitors.

Rationale: Since the paper does not reference integrase inhibitors at all, and the clinical trials were conducted prior to their common use, it can be inferred that all individuals in the paper were INSTI-naive.

Answer: Yes

---

Question: 4403 

Evidence: The paper does not provide specific counts of how many individuals received more than one ART regimen prior to or during the study.

Rationale: While the participants are treatment-experienced, the paper does not quantify the number of prior regimens or the number of individuals who received multiple regimens during the study period.

Answer: NA

---

Question: 4404 

Evidence: The paper does not provide specific counts of how many individuals received more than two ART regimens.

Rationale: The paper focuses on the current optimized background regimen within the trial and does not provide detailed historical data on the number of prior ART regimens for each participant.

Answer: NA

---

Question: 4405 

Evidence: The paper does not state that all individuals received the same number of ART regimens.

Rationale: As treatment-experienced individuals entering a trial, it is highly likely they had varied treatment histories with different numbers of prior regimens. The paper does not claim otherwise.

Answer: No

---

Question: 4406 

Evidence: The paper does not state that all individuals received one ART regimen.

Rationale: The participants are described as "treatment-experienced," which implies they had received at least one prior ART regimen before the optimized background regimen in the MOTIVATE trial.

Answer: No

---

Question: 4501 

Evidence: The paper does not mention dolutegravir.

Rationale: Dolutegravir is an integrase inhibitor. The paper does not mention any integrase inhibitors, as the studies were conducted before this drug class was widely used.

Answer: 0

---

Question: 4502 

Evidence: The paper does not mention darunavir.

Rationale: While darunavir is a protease inhibitor that was available at the time, the paper does not list the specific antiretroviral drugs received by individuals. It only refers to the collective "optimized background therapy."

Answer: NA

---

Question: 5101 

Evidence: The paper does not report on drug resistance mutations for drug classes other than CCR5 antagonists.

Rationale: The paper's focus is exclusively on V3-loop variants and their relationship to maraviroc susceptibility and clinical outcome. It does not report on the prevalence of classic drug resistance mutations (e.g., in reverse transcriptase or protease).

Answer: NA

---

Question: 5102 

Evidence: The paper does not mention integrase inhibitors or INSTI-resistance mutations.

Rationale: The study is centered on maraviroc and the V3 loop of the envelope gene. There is no analysis of the integrase gene or INSTI-resistance mutations.

Answer: 0

---

Question: 5103 

Evidence: The paper does not mention tenofovir (TDF) or TDF-resistance mutations.

Rationale: The paper focuses on envelope sequences and maraviroc. It does not report on resistance mutations in the pol gene, such as those conferring resistance to NRTIs like tenofovir.

Answer: 0

---

Question: 5104 

Evidence: The paper does not mention integrase inhibitors or INSTI-resistance mutations.

Rationale: As the paper does not study integrase inhibitors, it does not report any INSTI-resistance mutations.

Answer: NA

---

Question: 6101 

Evidence: Phenotypic susceptibility to maraviroc was determined with the PhenoSense Entry assay (Monogram Biosciences) and viruses classified as either maraviroc ~sus~ or maraviroc ~res~ based on an MPI cut-off value of 95%. ^20^

Rationale: The paper explicitly names the phenotypic susceptibility test used: the PhenoSense Entry assay. The parameter measured was the Maximum Percent Inhibition (MPI).

Answer: PhenoSense Entry assay

---

Question: 6102 

Evidence: Phenotypic susceptibility to maraviroc was determined with the PhenoSense Entry assay (Monogram Biosciences) and viruses classified as either maraviroc ~sus~ or maraviroc ~res~ based on an MPI cut-off value of 95%.

Rationale: The paper reports susceptibility results using the Maximum Percent Inhibition (MPI) metric, not IC50 or IC90 values.

Answer: No

---

Question: 6103 

Evidence: The paper reports susceptibility results using MPI, not IC50.

Rationale: The paper uses the Maximum Percent Inhibition (MPI) value to classify susceptibility (susceptible if MPI ≥95%, reduced susceptibility if MPI <95%). It does not report IC50 values or IC50 fold-change values.

Answer: No

---

Question: 6104 

Evidence: Phenotypic susceptibility to maraviroc was determined with the PhenoSense Entry assay (Monogram Biosciences) and viruses classified as either maraviroc ~sus~ or maraviroc ~res~ based on an MPI cut-off value of 95%. ^20^

Rationale: The paper clearly identifies the assay used for phenotypic susceptibility testing as the PhenoSense Entry assay.

Answer: PhenoSense Entry assay

---

Question: 6105 

Evidence: The paper does not mention replication capacity.

Rationale: The paper reports on phenotypic susceptibility (MPI) and genotypic sequences, but there is no discussion or data regarding viral replication capacity.

Answer: No

---

Question: 6106 

Evidence: Phenotypic susceptibility to maraviroc was determined with the PhenoSense Entry assay (Monogram Biosciences).

Rationale: The paper specifically states that phenotypic susceptibility testing was performed for maraviroc. It does not mention phenotypic testing for any other antiretroviral drugs.

Answer: Maraviroc

---

Question: 7101 

Evidence: These observations are in agreement with previous findings from initial investigations of maraviroc susceptibility in the MOTIVATE studies, whereby transferring on-treatment resistance-associated changes using site-directed mutagenesis did not always establish resistance in the virus on Day 1.20

Rationale: The paper references a previous study (reference 20) that used site-directed mutagenesis. However, the current paper itself does not report generating or studying any isolates created by site-directed mutagenesis; it analyzes viruses from clinical trial participants.

Answer: No

---

Question: 7102 

Evidence: Two gp120 third variable (V3)–loop amino acid variants, A19T and I26V, confer reduced maraviroc susceptibility in one R5 virus strain (CC1/85) selected during serial in vitro passage.12

Rationale: The paper references a previous study (reference 12) where in vitro passage experiments were conducted. The paper itself does not report conducting new in vitro passage experiments; its data comes from clinical samples from the MOTIVATE trials.

Answer: No
