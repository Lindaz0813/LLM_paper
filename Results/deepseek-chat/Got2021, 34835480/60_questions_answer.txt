Rationale: The Methods section provides a detailed description of the sequencing technology used, identifying it specifically as Sanger sequencing.

Answer: Yes

Question: 2503 

Evidence: The paper content does not mention Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) or any related technologies like Illumina, PacBio, or Ion Torrent.

Rationale: The sequencing method described is exclusively Sanger sequencing. There is no reference to any NGS platform or methodology.

Answer: No

Question: 2504 

Evidence: The paper content does not mention cloning of PCR products prior to sequencing.

Rationale: The described protocol involves amplifying the coding regions and then processing the PCR products directly for Sanger sequencing. There is no mention of a cloning step.

Answer: No

Question: 2505 

Evidence: The paper content does not mention single genome sequencing or single genome amplification (SGA).

Rationale: The methods describe bulk PCR amplification of the viral regions from plasma RNA, not a method that ensures amplification from a single genome template.

Answer: No

Question: 2506 

Evidence: The paper content does not mention molecular cloning.

Rationale: The described methodology involves direct sequencing of PCR products. There is no mention of inserting amplicons into a vector for cloning.

Answer: No

Question: 2603 

Evidence: We included 210 patients in this study. Only samples from 85 patients were successfully amplified. Altogether, 76 samples were sequenced for the RT region, 68 for the PR, and 46 for the INT.

Rationale: The paper states that sequencing was performed on viral RNA from plasma. It provides the number of patients whose samples were successfully amplified (85) and the number sequenced for each gene from those amplifications.

Answer: 85

Question: 2604 

Evidence: The paper content does not mention sequencing from PBMCs.

Rationale: As established in question 2602, all sequencing was performed on plasma-derived viral RNA. Therefore, zero samples underwent PBMC virus sequencing.

Answer: 0

Question: 2605 

Evidence: 35.3% of patients had a viral load above 100,000 copies/mL. According to the treatment of the patients and the viral load measured, we observed the presence of drug resistance mutations for all patients.

Rationale: The paper reports viral load data, indicating active viral replication in a significant portion of the cohort. The presence of resistance mutations in patients with virological failure also implies active replication.

Answer: Yes

Question: 2606 

Evidence: The paper content does not mention sequencing from proviral DNA.

Rationale: The source material for sequencing was explicitly plasma viral RNA, not cellular DNA from PBMCs which would harbor the proviral reservoir.

Answer: No

Question: 2701 

Evidence: The median age was 44 ± 14 years. The age range is provided as 6-72 years.

Rationale: The baseline characteristics table lists the minimum age as 6 years, indicating that children were included in the study population.

Answer: Yes

Question: 2702 

Evidence: The paper content does not describe the study as a clinical trial.

Rationale: The study is described as a cross-sectional study of patients from care centres. There is no mention of an interventional clinical trial.

Answer: No

Question: 2703 

Evidence: The paper content does not describe the study as a clinical trial.

Rationale: Since the study was not a clinical trial (as per 2702), it follows that not all individuals were in one.

Answer: No

Question: 3101 

Evidence: We included 210 patients in this study.

Rationale: The Results section explicitly states the total number of individuals included in the study from whom samples were obtained.

Answer: 210

Question: 3102 

Evidence: Only samples from 85 patients were successfully amplified.

Rationale: The paper states that of the 210 included patients, only 85 had samples that were successfully amplified and subsequently sequenced. Therefore, not all individuals underwent successful HIV sequencing.

Answer: No

Question: 4101 

Evidence: All patients were previously diagnosed with HIV-1 and were all ART-experienced. The study excluded newly diagnosed patients.

Rationale: The Methods section clearly states that all patients enrolled in the study were "ART-experienced" and that newly diagnosed patients were excluded.

Answer: No

Question: 4102 

Evidence: All patients were previously diagnosed with HIV-1 and were all ART-experienced.

Rationale: The paper explicitly and repeatedly states that the study population consisted entirely of ART-experienced patients.

Answer: Yes

Question: 4103 

Evidence: All patients were previously diagnosed with HIV-1 and were all ART-experienced.

Rationale: The study population is defined as exclusively ART-experienced. There is no mention of an ART-naive cohort for comparison.

Answer: No

Question: 4104 

Evidence: The paper content does not mention any ART-naive individuals.

Rationale: As established in previous answers, the study included only ART-experienced patients.

Answer: 0

Question: 4105 

Evidence: The paper reports current ART regimens and duration of ART exposure, but does not state that complete historical ART information was available for all patients.

Rationale: Table 1 provides data on "Current ART regimens" and "Duration of ART exposure," but the paper does not claim to have a complete, detailed ART history for every individual from the start of their treatment.

Answer: No

Question: 4201 

Evidence: The paper studies ART-experienced patients with clinical failure. Transmitted drug resistance is typically studied in ART-naive individuals.

Rationale: The study focuses on patients who have already been on treatment and have experienced clinical failure, which is the context for acquired drug resistance, not transmitted drug resistance.

Answer: No

Question: 4202 

Evidence: Pretreatment drug resistance is typically assessed in ART-naive individuals or before starting a new regimen. This study only includes ART-experienced patients.

Rationale: Since all patients were already on ART at the time of sampling, the resistance mutations reported are acquired, not pretreatment.

Answer: No

Question: 4301 

Evidence: The majority of patients (47.1%) were on first-line regimen AZT + 3TC + NVP or EFV (NRTIs and NNRTIs). 17.6% of the patients received a DTG-containing regimen (INSTI). 4.7% received LPV/r (PI).

Rationale: Table 1, "Current ART regimens," lists the drug combinations received by the patients, which include NRTIs, NNRTIs, INSTIs, and PIs.

Answer: NRTIs, NNRTIs, INSTIs, PIs

Question: 4302 

Evidence: 17.6% of the patients received a DTG-containing regimen, an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI).

Rationale: The paper explicitly states the percentage of patients who received an INSTI (Dolutegravir).

Answer: Yes

Question: 4303 

Evidence: (ABC or AZT) + 3TC + LPV/r (a protease inhibitor) was a regimen for 4.7% of patients.

Rationale: Table 1 lists a regimen containing the protease inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r).

Answer: Yes

Question: 4304 

Evidence: The paper reports multiple different ART regimens, including AZT+3TC+(NVP or EFV), TDF+3TC+EFV, DTG+3TC+(ABC or TDF), and (ABC or AZT)+3TC+LPV/r.

Rationale: Table 1 shows that patients were on several different drug combinations, demonstrating that they did not all receive the same ART.

Answer: No

Question: 4305 

Evidence: 17.6% of the patients received a DTG-containing regimen. No major INSTI mutation was observed.

Rationale: The fact that 82.4% of patients were not on a DTG-containing regimen, coupled with the absence of major INSTI mutations, suggests that the vast majority of the cohort was INSTI-naive. The paper discusses the absence of INSTI mutations in the context of INSTI-naive settings.

Answer: Yes

Question: 4403 

Evidence: The paper content does not provide specific data on how many individuals had received more than one ART regimen.

Rationale: While the paper mentions first-line and second-line regimens conceptually, it does not provide a count or breakdown of patients based on the number of prior regimens they have received.

Answer: NA

Question: 4404 

Evidence: The paper content does not provide specific data on how many individuals had received more than two ART regimens.

Rationale: The paper does not provide data on the number of prior regimens for individuals.

Answer: NA

Question: 4405 

Evidence: The paper content does not provide information to confirm that all individuals received the same number of ART regimens.

Rationale: The duration of ART exposure varies among patients (from ≤24 months to ≥48 months), making it unlikely they all had the same number of regimens, but the paper does not explicitly state this.

Answer: NA

Question: 4406 

Evidence: The paper content does not provide information to confirm that all individuals received only one ART regimen.

Rationale: The paper does not provide a history of regimen changes for the individuals.

Answer: NA

Question: 4501 

Evidence: DTG+3TC + (ABC or TDF) was a regimen for 15 (17.6%) of the patients.

Rationale: Table 1 provides the number and percentage of patients who were on a Dolutegravir (DTG)-containing regimen at the time of the study.

Answer: 15

Question: 4502 

Evidence: The paper content does not mention the drug darunavir.

Rationale: A search of the paper content finds no reference to darunavir. The only protease inhibitor mentioned is lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r).

Answer: 0

Question: 5101 

Evidence: We observed the presence of drug resistance mutations for all patients.

Rationale: The Results section explicitly states that drug resistance mutations were observed in all patients for whom sequencing was performed.

Answer: 85

Question: 5102 

Evidence: Interestingly, even if 17.6% of the patients received DTG as part of their regimen, no major INSTI mutation was observed.

Rationale: The paper clearly states that no major INSTI resistance mutations were found in any of the sequenced samples.

Answer: 0

Question: 5103 

Evidence: The paper content does not provide a specific count of individuals with TDF-resistance mutations.

Rationale: While the paper lists various NRTI mutations (like K65R, M184V, etc.), it does not provide a specific countQuestion: 5104 

Evidence: Interestingly, even if 17.6% of the patients received DTG as part of their regimen, no major INSTI mutation was observed. Still, T97A (38%) and L74I (38%) were abundantly selected. Additionally, mutations N144D, V151L and E157Q were less frequently observed, with a prevalence of 5% each.

Rationale: The paper explicitly states that no major INSTI mutations were found. It then lists the accessory or polymorphic mutations that were observed: T97A, L74I, N144D, V151L, and E157Q. These are not classified as major resistance mutations in this context.

Answer: No major INSTI resistance mutations were reported. The accessory/polymorphic mutations observed were T97A, L74I, N144D, V151L, and E157Q.

Question: 6101 

Evidence: The paper content does not contain any description of phenotypic susceptibility testing.

Rationale: The methods for drug resistance assessment are entirely genotypic, based on sequencing and the use of algorithms (ANRS, WHO). There is no mention of any phenotypic assay being used.

Answer: NA

Question: 6102 

Evidence: The paper content does not contain any description of phenotypic susceptibility testing or the reporting of IC values.

Rationale: As no phenotypic testing was performed, values such as IC50 or IC90 are not reported.

Answer: No

Question: 6103 

Evidence: The paper content does not contain any description of phenotypic susceptibility testing or the reporting of fold-change values.

Rationale: As no phenotypic testing was performed, fold-change values are not reported.

Evidence: The paper content does not contain any description of a phenotypic susceptibility assay.

Rationale: The resistance data is derived solely from genotypic sequencing.

Answer: NA

Question: 6105 

Evidence: The paper content does not contain any data or mention of replication capacity assays.

Rationale: A thorough review of the paper finds no reference to experiments measuring viral replication capacity or fitness.

Answer: No

Question: 6106 

Evidence: The paper content does not contain any description of phenotypic drug susceptibility testing.

Rationale: Since no phenotypic testing was conducted, no drugs were tested using such an assay.

Answer: NA

Question: 7101 

Evidence: The paper content does not mention the creation or analysis of site-directed mutants.

Rationale: All viruses sequenced were natural isolates from patients. There is no description of engineering specific mutations into a viral backbone in the laboratory.

Answer: No

Question: 7102 

Evidence: The paper content does not mention any in vitro passage experiments.

Rationale: As established in question 1103, the paper does not describe any virus being passaged in cell culture. All sequences are from direct patient samples.

Answer: No
