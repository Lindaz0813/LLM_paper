**Question: 2202**

Evidence: NA

Rationale: The paper reports HIV sequences and subtypes but does not provide any lists of specific mutations, such as drug resistance mutations, for individual sequenced isolates.

Answer: No

***

**Question: 2301**

Evidence: We investigated for the first time the subtype distribution, prevalence of multiple HIV-1 infections, sexual networks, and partnership histories in a cohort of women engaged in high-risk sexual behavior.

Rationale: The paper consistently refers to the virus being studied as "HIV-1" throughout the text, including in the title and abstract. There is no mention of HIV-2.

Answer: HIV-1

***

**Question: 2302**

Evidence: Subtype distribution in these two genes was 54.3% (n = 114) A/A, 2.9% (n=6) C/C, 24.3% (n=51) D/D, 11.9% (n=25) A/D, 4.8% (n=10) D/A, 0.5% (n=1) C/A, 1.0% (n=2) B/A, and 0.5% (n = 1) B/D.

Answer: A, C, D, B (and recombinants like A/D, D/A, C/A, B/A, B/D)

***

**Question: 2303**

Evidence: Viral RNA was extracted from blood samples collected from 324 HIV-1-positive women; the gp-41 and pol-IN genes were directly sequenced.

Answer: gp-41, pol-IN

***

**Question: 2304**

Evidence: Viral RNA was extracted from blood samples collected from 324 HIV-1-positive women; the gp-41 and pol-IN genes were directly sequenced.

Answer: 2008-2009

***

**Question: 2502**

Evidence: The purified PCR products were directly sequenced in the sense and antisense directions with primers GP46F2 and GP47R2 for gp-41 and Unipol1 and Unipol2 for pol-IN.

***

**Question: 2504**

Evidence: Individuals found to have phylogenetically similar viruses and those with recombinant viruses were analyzed further in the pol-IN gene. The cleaned pol-IN secondary PCR products were cloned, and between 10 and 20 positive clones were sequenced.

Rationale: The paper explicitly states that for a subset of samples (those with similar or recombinant viruses), the PCR products were cloned prior to sequencing to investigate multiple infections.

Answer: Yes

***

**Question: 2505**

Evidence: NA

Rationale: The paper mentions "clonal sequencing" but does not use the term "single genome sequencing" or describe a method that limits PCR amplification to a single template, which is the defining feature of single genome sequencing.

Answer: No

***

**Question: 2506**

Evidence: The cleaned pol-IN secondary PCR products were cloned, and between 10 and 20 positive clones were sequenced.

Rationale: The process described—inserting PCR products into a vector, transforming bacteria, and picking multiple colonies for sequencing—is the definition of molecular cloning.

***

**Question: 2603**

Evidence: Blood samples were collected from 324 consenting HIV-infected women. Viral RNA was extracted from cryopreserved plasma.

Evidence: Blood samples were collected from 324 consenting HIV-infected women.

Rationale: The methods section clearly states that blood samples were obtained from 324 HIV-positive women for the purpose of viral sequencing.

Answer: 324

***

**Question: 3102**

Evidence: Subtyping in both gp-41 and pol-IN was successfully done in 210/324 (64.8%) women.

Rationale: The results show that successful sequencing data for both genes was only obtained from 210 out of the 324 women who provided samples, indicating that not all individuals underwent successful HIV sequencing for the full analysis.

Answer: No

***

**Question: 4101**

Evidence: Blood samples were collected from 324 consenting HIV-infected women with unknown seroconversion dates at testing. The failure to obtain sequence data was either due to failed PCR or failed sequencing probably as a result of low viral loads as some of the women were reported to be on ART.

Rationale: The text mentions that some women were on ART, which implies that not all participants were ART-naive. However, it does not explicitly state that any individuals were ART-naive. The ART status of the cohort is not clearly defined beyond this indirect reference.

Answer: NA

***

**Question: 4102**

Evidence: The failure to obtain sequence data was either due to failed PCR or failed sequencing probably as a result of low viral loads as some of the women were reported to be on ART.

Rationale: The paper explicitly states that "some of the women were reported to be on ART," confirming that there were ART-experienced individuals in the study.

Answer: Yes

***

**Question: 4103**

Evidence: The failure to obtain sequence data was either due to failed PCR or failed sequencing probably as a result of low viral loads as some of the women were reported to be on ART.

Rationale: The paper confirms the presence of ART-experienced individuals. However, it does not explicitly confirm the presence of ART-naive individuals; it only states that seroconversion dates were unknown and that *some* were on ART, leaving the status of others unclear.

Answer: NA

***

**Question: 4104**

Evidence: NA

Rationale: The paper does not provide a specific number or percentage of participants who were ART-naive. It only mentions that "some" were on ART.

Answer: NA

***

**Question: 4105**

Evidence: NA

Rationale: The paper does not provide complete ART history for the participants. It only mentions in passing that "some" women were on ART, with no details on specific drugs, duration of therapy, or history for all 324 individuals.

Answer: No

***

**Question: 4201**

Evidence: NA

Rationale: The paper focuses on HIV subtypes, phylogenetics, and multiple infections. There is no analysis or mention of transmitted drug resistance mutations.

Answer: No

***

**Question: 4202**

Evidence: NA

Answer: NA

***

**Question: 4304**

Evidence: NA

Rationale: The paper does not provide any details about the ART regimens of the participants, so it is impossible to determine if they were all the same.

Answer: NA

***

**Question: 4305**

Evidence: NA

Rationale: Since there is no mention of integrase inhibitors being used by any participants, and the study was conducted in 2008-2009 when INSTIs were not widely available in Uganda, it is highly likely they were INSTI-naive. However, the paper does not explicitly state this.

Answer: NA
