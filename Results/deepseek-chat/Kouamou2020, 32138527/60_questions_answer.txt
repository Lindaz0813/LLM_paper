Question: 1103 

Evidence: The paper content describes a clinical study of adolescents and young adults failing first-line ART and their response to second-line treatment. There is no mention of in vitro passage experiments anywhere in the provided text.

Rationale: After reviewing the entire paper content, including the abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion, no references to in vitro passage experiments were found. The study is entirely clinical and observational.

Answer: No

Question: 1104 

Evidence: Total genotypic susceptibility scores were calculated for first-line regimens (GSS1). For each NRTI and NNRTI drug prescribed, a GSS value of 1 was assigned if resistance was not identified, a value of 0.5 was assigned to intermediate resistance and 0 was assigned when mutations predicted high-level resistance. Total genotypic susceptibility scores were also calculated for second-line regimens (GSS2).

Rationale: The paper reports on genotypic susceptibility scores (GSS) which are computational predictions of antiretroviral susceptibility based on the detected mutations. It does not report any results from in vitro phenotypic susceptibility tests, which measure drug activity against the virus in a laboratory setting.

Answer: No

Question: 4103 

Evidence: We sequenced plasma viral RNA from 74 adolescents and young adults (16–24 years) failing first-line ART at Newlands Clinic, Zimbabwe.

Rationale: The paper only reports on individuals who were ART-experienced (failing first-line therapy). It does not include any ART-naive individuals.

Answer: No

Question: 4104 

Evidence: The paper only reports on individuals who were ART-experienced (failing first-line therapy). It does not include any ART-naive individuals.

Rationale: Since no ART-naive individuals were included in the study, the number of samples from such individuals is zero.

Answer: 0

Question: 4105 

Evidence: First-line ART was provided as FDCs of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/lamivudine (TDF +3TC), abacavir/lamivudine (ABC +3TC), or zidovudine/lamivudine (AZT +3TC). These were combined with either efavirenz (EFV) or nevirapine (NVP). Second-line treatment was with a PI, either ritonavir-boosted atazanavir (ATV/r) or ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (LPV/r) with TDF +3TC or ABC +3TC or AZT +3TC.

Rationale: The paper provides detailed information on the first-line and second-line regimens received by the participants. It does not, however, provide a complete individual-level ART history for each participant beyond the regimens mentioned at the point of failure and switch.

Answer: No

Question: 4201 

Evidence: We sequenced plasma viral RNA from 74 adolescents and young adults (16–24 years) failing first-line ART at Newlands Clinic, Zimbabwe.

Rationale: Transmitted drug resistance refers to resistance mutations found in individuals who are ART-naive. This study exclusively sequenced individuals who were ART-experienced and failing treatment, so it does not report on transmitted HIV drug resistance.

Answer: No

Question: 4202 

Evidence: We sequenced plasma viral RNA from 74 adolescents and young adults (16–24 years) failing first-line ART at Newlands Clinic, Zimbabwe.

Rationale: Pretreatment drug resistance is a term often used for resistance found in ART-naive individuals or in individuals before starting a new regimen. This study sequenced individuals who were already on and failing a first-line regimen, so it reports on acquired resistance, not pretreatment resistance.

Answer: No

Question: 4301 

Evidence: First-line ART was provided as FDCs of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/lamivudine (TDF +3TC), abacavir/lamivudine (ABC +3TC), or zidovudine/lamivudine (AZT +3TC). These were combined with either efavirenz (EFV) or nevirapine (NVP). Second-line treatment was with a PI, either ritonavir-boosted atazanavir (ATV/r) or ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (LPV/r) with TDF +3TC or ABC +3TC or AZT +3TC.

Rationale: The paper explicitly lists the drug classes used in first-line (NRTIs, NNRTIs) and second-line (NRTIs, PIs) regimens.

Answer: NRTIs, NNRTIs, Protease Inhibitors

Question: 4302 

Evidence: The discussion mentions dolutegravir (DTG) in the context of future recommendations, but the study itself reports on participants receiving first-line NNRTI-based regimens and second-line PI-based regimens. There is no mention of any participant in the study having received an integrase inhibitor.

Rationale: The reported treatment regimens for the study participants are limited to NRTIs, NNRTIs, and PIs. Integrase inhibitors were not part of the administered therapy.

Answer: No

Question: 4303 

Evidence: Second-line treatment was with a PI, either ritonavir-boosted atazanavir (ATV/r) or ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (LPV/r) with TDF +3TC or ABC +3TC or AZT +3TC. Among the 74 participants failing NNRTI-based first-line ART, 62 (84%) were switched to a bPI-based second-line ART.

Rationale: A majority of the participants (62 out of 74) were switched to a protease inhibitor-based second-line regimen.

Answer: Yes

Question: 4304 

Evidence: First-line ART regimens, n (%) : TDF + 3TC + EFV/NVP 54 (73%), AZT + 3TC + EFV/NVP 17 (23%), ABC + 3TC + EFV/NVP 3 (4%). Second-line ART regimens at switch, n (%) : TDF + 3TC + ATV/r 23 (37%), AZT + 3TC + ATV/r 9 (15%), AZT + 3TC + LPV/r 2 (3%), ABC + 3TC + ATV/r 22 (35%), ABC + 3TC + LPV/r 6 (10%).

Rationale: Table 1 shows that participants received different first-line and second-line regimens, indicating they did not all receive the same ART.

Answer: No

Question: 4305 

Evidence: The discussion mentions dolutegravir (DTG) in the context of future recommendations, but the study itself reports on participants receiving first-line NNRTI-based regimens and second-line PI-based regimens.

Rationale: Since integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) like dolutegravir were not part of the treatment regimens used in this study, all participants were INSTI-naive.

Answer: Yes

Question: 4403 

Evidence: Among 726 adolescents and young adults (16--24 years) who were receiving first-line ART... 74 (10%) had a confirmedQuestion: 4403

Evidence: Among 726 adolescents and young adults (16--24 years) who were receiving first-line ART at the Newlands Clinic between October 2015 and December 2016, 74 (10%) had a confirmed VL >1,000 copies/mL after 12 weeks of EACGI. Among the 74 participants failing NNRTI-based first-line ART, 62 (84%) were switched to a bPI-based second-line ART.

Rationale: The paper states that 62 out of the 74 participants who failed first-line ART were switched to a second-line regimen. This means these 62 individuals received more than one ART regimen.

Answer: 62

Question: 4404

Evidence: The paper describes participants failing first-line ART and then being switched to second-line ART. There is no mention of any participant receiving a third-line regimen or more than two ART regimens.

Rationale: The study focuses exclusively on the transition from first-line to second-line therapy. The results and discussion sections only refer to these two regimens.

Answer: 0

Question: 4405

Evidence: Among the 74 participants failing NNRTI-based first-line ART, 62 (84%) were switched to a bPI-based second-line ART, one (1%) remained on first-line ART and suppressed at ≥48 weeks of follow-up. The remaining 11 (15%) participants left clinical care and were lost to follow-up.

Rationale: Not all participants received the same number of regimens. Sixty-two were switched to a second regimen, one remained on the first regimen, and eleven were lost to follow-up before a switch.

Answer: No

Question: 4406

Evidence: Among the 74 participants failing NNRTI-based first-line ART, 62 (84%) were switched to a bPI-based second-line ART.

Rationale: Since 62 participants were switched to a second-line regimen, they received more than one ART regimen. Therefore, not all individuals received only one regimen.

Answer: No

Question: 4501

Evidence: The discussion mentions dolutegravir (DTG) in the context of future recommendations, but the study itself reports on participants receiving first-line NNRTI-based regimens and second-line PI-based regimens.

Rationale: The reported treatment regimens for the study participants are limited to NRTIs, NNRTIs, and PIs. Dolutegravir, an integrase inhibitor, was not part of the therapy administered to any participant in this study.

Answer: 0

Question: 4502

Evidence: Second-line treatment was with a PI, either ritonavir-boosted atazanavir (ATV/r) or ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (LPV/r).

Rationale: The paper specifies that the protease inhibitors used in second-line were atazanavir/ritonavir (ATV/r) and lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r). Darunavir is not mentioned anywhere in the text.

Answer: 0

Question: 5101

Evidence: HIV DRMs were detected in 72/74 (97%) participants after EAC and confirmed VF.

Rationale: The results section explicitly states the number and percentage of participants found to have one or more drug resistance mutation.

Answer: 72

Question: 5102

Evidence: The study itself reports on participants receiving first-line NNRTI-based regimens and second-line PI-based regimens. There is no mention of any participant having received an integrase inhibitor.

Rationale: Since no participants received integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs), the study would not report on or test for INSTI-resistance mutations.

Answer: 0

Question: 5103

Evidence: NRTI DRMs were found in 84% with the most common being M184V (72%), K65R (41%), and thymidine analog mutations (32%). The combination of K65R and M184V, associated with ABC, TDF, and 3TC resistance was identified in 28/74 (38%) participants.

Rationale: The K65R mutation is specifically mentioned as causing high-level resistance to tenofovir (TDF). The paper states that K65R was found in 41% of participants, which is 30 out of 74 individuals (0.41 * 74 ≈ 30). The exact number is not given, but the percentage is.

Answer: 41% (30/74)

Question: 5104

Evidence: The study itself reports on participants receiving first-line NNRTI-based regimens and second-line PI-based regimens. There is no mention of any participant having received an integrase inhibitor.

Rationale: Since no participants received INSTIs, the paper does not report any INSTI-resistance mutations.

Answer: NA

Question: 6101

Evidence: The paper reports on genotypic susceptibility scores (GSS) which are computational predictions of antiretroviral susceptibility based on the detected mutations. It does not report any results from in vitro phenotypic susceptibility tests.

Rationale: The methods and results sections describe genotypic analysis and the calculation of genotypic susceptibility scores (GSS). There is no description of a phenotypic susceptibility test being performed.

Answer: NA

Question: 6102

Evidence: The paper reports on genotypic susceptibility scores (GSS). It does not report any results from in vitro phenotypic susceptibility tests.

Rationale: IC50 and IC90 values are metrics from phenotypic susceptibility assays. Since no phenotypic testing was performed, these values are not reported.

Answer: No

Question: 6103

Evidence: The paper reports on genotypic susceptibility scores (GSS). It does not report any results from in vitro phenotypic susceptibility tests.

Rationale: IC50 fold change values are derived from phenotypic susceptibility assays. The paper does not contain any phenotypic data.
