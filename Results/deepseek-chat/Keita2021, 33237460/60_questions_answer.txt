Question: 1101

Evidence: No data concerning antiretroviral drug’s (ARV) primary resistance mutation rates in Chad are available. To date, no published data concerning ARV primary resistance mutation rates in Chad are available. In the present report, we retrospectively investigated frozen dried blood spot (DBS) samples from HIV-1 Chadian patients who were naïve of ARV.

Rationale: The paper explicitly states that no data on primary ARV resistance mutation rates in Chad were available prior to this study, and that this is the first report investigating this specific topic using frozen DBS samples from ARV-naïve patients in Chad.
