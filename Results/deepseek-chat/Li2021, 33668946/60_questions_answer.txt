Evidence: Based on Sanger sequencing, 19.5% (34/174) of the patients were shown to have drug resistance variants. With NGS, the rate of resistance was the same; 20.7% (36/174) at the detection thresholds 20% and 15%.

Rationale: The paper provides the number and percentage of individuals found to have one or more drug resistance mutations using Sanger sequencing (34/174) and NGS at a 20% threshold (36/174). The Sanger sequencing result of 34 individuals is a clear answer.

Answer: 34

Question: 5102 

Evidence: The paper does not contain any information about INSTI-resistance mutations.

Rationale: The study sequenced the PR and RT regions of the pol gene. Integrase is a different part of the pol gene that was not sequenced. Therefore, no data on INSTI-resistance mutations could be reported.

Answer: 0

Question: 5103 

Evidence: K65R was the most common minority mutation, of 95.1% (58/61) and 93.1% (54/58) in CRF07_BC and CRF08_BC, respectively, when compared with 5.7% (2/35) in CRF01_AE (p<0.001). In NRTI DRMs, K65R was the highest (1.2%) at a >5% frequency.

Rationale: The K65R mutation is reported to cause high-level resistance to tenofovir (TDF). The paper provides the prevalence of this mutation among different subtypes. However, it does not provide a single, overall count of individuals found to have a TDF-resistance mutation. The numbers given are percentages within subtypes, not a total count across all 174 patients.
