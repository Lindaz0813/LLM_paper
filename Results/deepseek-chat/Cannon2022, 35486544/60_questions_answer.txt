Question: 1101

Evidence: The current analysis includes data from all cases of newly diagnosed and reported HIV in adult MSM in King County from October 2013 to August 2021. These activities were conducted as part of a public health PrEP program evaluation and therefore were not considered human subjects research.

Rationale: The paper describes the collection and analysis of original data from a specific population (MSM in King County, WA) over a defined time period (2013-2021). It explicitly states this is an analysis of newly collected surveillance and partner notification data, and that the activities were part of a public health program evaluation, indicating this is previously unpublished data.
