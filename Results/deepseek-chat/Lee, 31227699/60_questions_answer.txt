**Question: 1102**

Evidence: All raw HIV sequence data that support the findings of this study have been deposited in GenBank (accession numbers MK643536–MK643827 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ WebSub/?form=dwnld&sid=2204500&tool=genbank]). Here, we use near-full-length, single genome next-generation sequencing to longitudinally genotype and quantify subtype C HIV-1 DNA in four women identified during acute HIV-1 infection.

Rationale: The paper's abstract describes the use of sequencing to genotype HIV-1 DNA. Furthermore, the "Data availability" section confirms that the raw HIV sequence data have been deposited in GenBank, providing direct evidence that the paper reports HIV sequences.

Answer: Yes

***

**Question: 1103**

Evidence: The paper content does not contain any mention of in vitro passage experiments.

Rationale: A thorough review of the paper's Abstract, Introduction, Results, Discussion, and Methods sections finds no reference to in vitro passage experiments. The study is focused on the longitudinal analysis of HIV-1 DNA from human participants, not on experiments involving the passage of virus in cell culture.

Answer: No

***

**Question: 1104**

Evidence: The paper content does not contain any mention of in vitro antiretroviral susceptibility testing, IC50, IC90, or fold-change values.

Rationale: A thorough review of the paper's Abstract, Introduction, Results, Discussion, and Methods sections finds no reference to in vitro antiretroviral susceptibility assays or the data they produce (e.g., IC50, fold-change). The study is genotypic and evolutionary, not phenotypic.

Answer: No

***

**Question: 2101**

Evidence: All raw HIV sequence data that support the findings of this study have been deposited in GenBank (accession numbers MK643536–MK643827 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ WebSub/?form=dwnld&sid=2204500&tool=genbank]).

Rationale: The "Data availability" section explicitly provides the GenBank accession numbers (MK643536–MK643827) for the HIV sequences generated in this study.

Answer: Yes

***

**Question: 2102**

Evidence: All raw HIV sequence data that support the findings of this study have been deposited in GenBank (accession numbers MK643536–MK643827 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ WebSub/?form=dwnld&sid=2204500&tool=genbank]). Here, we use near-full-length, single genome next-generation sequencing to longitudinally genotype and quantify subtype C HIV-1 DNA in four women identified during acute HIV-1 infection.

Rationale: The paper reports GenBank accession numbers for HIV-1 sequences derived from clinical isolates obtained from participants in the FRESH cohort. The text does not mention the sequencing or use of any laboratory-adapted HIV isolates (e.g., HXB2 is used only as a reference sequence for analysis, not as a sequenced isolate from this study). Therefore, the reported accession numbers are exclusively for non-laboratory isolates.

Answer: Yes

***

**Question: 2103**

Evidence: All raw HIV sequence data that support the findings of this study have been deposited in GenBank (accession numbers MK643536–MK643827 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ WebSub/?form=dwnld&sid=2204500&tool=genbank]).

Rationale: The "Data availability" section provides the specific range of GenBank accession numbers for the sequences reported in the paper: MK643536 to MK643827.

Answer: MK643536–MK643827

***

**Question: 2202**

Evidence: In Pt 1, whose regimen contained raltegravir from the beginning of the antiretroviral treatment initiation, a genome-intact provirus harboring a single-base substitution at 1-month post-detection translated into Y143H, an integrase inhibitor-associated resistance mutation. Furthermore, we only observed mutations in HLA-B*58:01-restricted Nef epitopes among all HIV proteins examined.

Rationale: The paper reports specific mutations found in individual sequenced isolates. For example, it identifies the Y143H integrase mutation in a provirus from Patient 1. It also details specific escape mutations in Nef epitopes (e.g., in regions KF9/AL9, YY9, YF9) for Patient 4. This constitutes reporting lists of mutations for individual sequenced isolates.

Answer: Yes

***

**Question: 2301**

Evidence: Here, we use near-full-length, single genome next-generation sequencing to longitudinally genotype and quantify subtype C HIV-1 DNA in four women identified during acute HIV-1 infection. In this report, we provide a longitudinal evaluation of HIV-1 DNA sequences in four subtype C HIV-1-infected individuals.

Rationale: The paper consistently refers to the virus being studied as "HIV-1". There is no mention of HIV-2 or any other HIV species.

Answer: HIV-1

***

**Question: 2302**

Evidence: Here, we use near-full-length, single genome next-generation sequencing to longitudinally genotype and quantify subtype C HIV-1 DNA in four women identified during acute HIV-1 infection. In this report, we provide a longitudinal evaluation of HIV-1 DNA sequences in four subtype C HIV-1-infected individuals.

Rationale: The abstract and introduction explicitly state that the study focuses on "subtype C" HIV-1.

Answer: Subtype C

***

**Question: 2303**

Evidence: We performed single-genome, near-full-length next-generation HIV-1 DNA sequencing. Our near-full-length viral genome sequencing method involved PCR amplification spanning HXB2 coordinates 638 (Lys tRNA primer binding site) to 9632 (3′LTR R repeat).

Rationale: The methods section describes the sequencing approach as "near-full-length," covering coordinates 638 to 9632 in the HXB2 reference genome. This encompasses all major HIV-1 genes from the 5' LTR through Gag, Pol, Vif, Vpr, Tat, Rev, Vpu, Env, and Nef to the 3' LTR.

Answer: Near-full-length genomes (covering all major HIV-1 genes)

***

**Question: 2304**

Evidence: We performed single-genome, near-full-length next-generation HIV-1 DNA sequencing. Our near-full-length viral genome sequencing method involved PCR amplification spanning HXB2 coordinates 638 (Lys tRNA primer binding site) to 9632 (3′LTR R repeat).

Rationale: Since the paper reports sequencing of "near-full-length" genomes, which includes the region from coordinate 638 to 9632, this necessarily includes the *pol* gene. Therefore, the results are based on HIV sequences that include *pol*.

Answer: Yes

***

**Question: 2401**

Evidence: Here, we use near-full-length, single genome next-generation sequencing to longitudinally genotype and quantify subtype C HIV-1 DNA in four women identified during acute HIV-1 infection in Durban, South Africa. The FRESH cohort is an observational, prospective cohort launched in 2012 in Umlazi, Durban, South Africa.

Rationale: The abstract and methods section specify that the study participants were from the FRESH cohort in Durban, South Africa.

Answer: Durban, South Africa

***

**Question: 2402**

Evidence: The FRESH cohort is an observational, prospective cohort launched in 2012 in Umlazi, Durban, South Africa where high-risk HIV-negative women aged 18--23 were recruited to received twice-weekly HIV-1 RNA PCR testing by finger prick during 96 weeks of surveillance, later revised to 48 weeks. As of August 2018, 946 women were enrolled; 72 were identified with acute HIV-1 infection.

Rationale: The paper states the cohort was launched in 2012 and provides a snapshot of enrollment as of August 2018. The four patients studied were identified with acute infection during this timeframe. The paper does not provide the specific years individual samples were obtained, but the overall study period is between 2012 and at least 2018.

Answer: The study was conducted between 2012 and at least 2018; specific sample collection years are not provided.

***

**Question: 2502**

Evidence: The paper content does not contain any mention of Sanger sequencing.

Rationale: The paper explicitly describes using "next-generation sequencing" and "MiSeq (Illumina) deep sequencing". There is no mention of Sanger sequencing being used for the primary sequence data generation in this study.

Answer: No

***

**Question: 2503**

Evidence: Here, we use near-full-length, single genome next-generation sequencing to longitudinally genotype and quantify subtype C HIV-1 DNA. All PCR amplicons detectable by gel electrophoresis were subjected to Illumina library preparation via shearing-based adaptor-ligation-based technology and MiSeq sequencing.

Rationale: The abstract and methods section explicitly state that "next-generation sequencing" was used, and specify the technology as "MiSeq (Illumina)".

Answer: Yes

***

**Question: 2504**

Evidence: The paper content does not contain any mention of molecular cloning.

Rationale: The methods describe "single-genome amplification" followed directly by NGS library preparation and sequencing. There is no mention of a cloning step in bacteria or yeast between the amplification and sequencing steps.

Answer: No

***

**Question: 2505**

Evidence: Here, we use near-full-length, single genome next-generation sequencing to longitudinally genotype and quantify subtype C HIV-1 DNA. We performed single-genome, near-full-length next-generation HIV-1 DNA sequencing.

Rationale: The abstract and results sections repeatedly state that "single-genome" sequencing was the method used. This is a specific technique to avoid in vitro recombination.

Answer: Yes

***

**Question: 2506**

Evidence: The paper content does not contain any mention of molecular cloning.

Rationale: As with question 2504, the process described is "single-genome amplification" followed by NGS, with no intervening cloning step mentioned.

Answer: No

***

**Question: 2601**

Evidence: The paper content does not contain any mention of plasma virus sequencing.

Rationale: The entire study focuses on HIV-1 DNA from PBMCs. The methods section details DNA extraction from PBMCs and sequencing of HIV-1 DNA. While plasma viral load is monitored, the sequences reported are exclusively from PBMC-derived DNA.

Answer: No

***

**Question: 2602**

Evidence: We performed single-genome, near-full-length next-generation HIV-1 DNA sequencing. Total PBMC collected from each patient at each time point were independently subjected to DNA extraction using DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kits (QIAGEN).

Rationale: The paper explicitly states that sequencing was performed on DNA extracted from PBMCs (Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells).

Answer: Yes

***

**Question: 2603**

Evidence: The paper content does not contain any mention of plasma virus sequencing.

Rationale: As established for question 2601, the study only reports sequences derived from PBMC DNA. Therefore, zero samples underwent plasma virus sequencing for the results presented.

Answer: 0

***

**Question: 2604**

Evidence: Overall, this study collected a total of 292 HIV-1 DNA sequences in all four patients sequentially sampled over a 1-year follow-up period. Total PBMC collected from each patient at each time point were independently subjected to DNA extraction.

Rationale: The results state that a total of 292 HIV-1 DNA sequences were obtained from the four patients over multiple time points. All sequences were derived from PBMC samples.

Answer: All sequences (292 total) were from PBMC virus sequencing.

***

**Question: 2605**

Evidence: Pt 2 remained untreated for the entire follow-up period of 328 days. Pt 4 remained untreated for the entire follow-up period of 332 days. In both untreated patients (Pt 2 and Pt 4) demonstrated a spontaneous graduate 2-log decrease of plasma viral load over 1 year.

Rationale: Patients 2 and 4 remained untreated and had detectable viremia throughout the study, indicating active HIV replication. Sequences were obtained from these individuals.

Answer: Yes (Sequences were obtained from Patients 2 and 4, who were untreated and had active replication).

***

**Question: 2606**

Evidence: We performed single-genome, near-full-length next-generation HIV-1 DNA sequencing. Our near-full-length viral genome sequencing method involved PCR amplification spanning HXB2 coordinates 638 (Lys tRNA primer binding site) to 9632 (3′LTR R repeat), and therefore could theoretically amplify both episomal 2-LTR HIV-1 DNA and integrated proviral genomes.

Rationale: The study sequences HIV-1 DNA from PBMCs. The authors note this DNA could include both integrated proviral DNA and episomal forms, but the proviral DNA reservoir is a key component of what is being sequenced.

Answer: Yes

***

**Question: 2701**

Evidence: The FRESH cohort is an observational, prospective cohort launched in 2012 in Umlazi, Durban, South Africa where high-risk HIV-negative women aged 18--23 were recruited.

Rationale: The participants were women aged 18-23, which classifies them as adults, not infants or children.

Answer: No

***

**Question: 2702**

Evidence: The FRESH cohort is an observational, prospective cohort. Following detection of acute HIV-1 infections, PBMCs were collected... and are invited to participate in an observational cohort study.

Rationale: The paper describes the FRESH cohort as an "observational" study. It does not describe it as an interventional clinical trial.

Answer: No

***

**Question: 2703**

Evidence: The FRESH cohort is an observational, prospective cohort.

Rationale: Since the study is observational and not a clinical trial, it follows that not all individuals were in a clinical trial.

Answer: No

***

**Question: 3101**

Evidence: Four female individuals (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1 ) identified in primary HIV-1 infection were non-randomly selected for this study. Overall, this study collected a total of 292 HIV-1 DNA sequences in all four patients sequentially sampled over a 1-year follow-up period.

Rationale: The paper clearly states that four individuals were selected for the study and that HIV sequencing was performed on all of them.

Answer: 4

***

**Question: 3102**

Evidence: Four female individuals (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1 ) identified in primary HIV-1 infection were non-randomly selected for this study. Overall, this study collected a total of 292 HIV-1 DNA sequences in all four patients sequentially sampled over a 1-year follow-up period.

Rationale: The study is based on these four individuals, and sequencing results are presented for all of them. Therefore, all individuals in the paper underwent HIV sequencing.

Answer: Yes

***

**Question: 4101**

Evidence: Pt 2 remained untreated for the entire follow-up period of 328 days. Pt 4 remained untreated for the entire follow-up period of 332 days.

Rationale: Patients 2 and 4 remained untreated for the entire study duration, meaning they were ART-naive at the time their samples were obtained for sequencing.

Answer: Yes

***

**Question: 4102**

Evidence: Pt 1 immediately initiated antiretroviral therapy (tenofovir, emtricitabine, efavirenz, raltegravir) after first detection of HIV-1 plasma viremia. Pt 3 immediately received antiretroviral treatment (tenofovir, emtricitabine, efavirenz) when plasma HIV-1 RNA was first detectable.

Rationale: Patients 1 and 3 initiated ART during the study, meaning sequences were also obtained from individuals who had received ARV drugs.

Answer: Yes

***

**Question: 4103**

Evidence: Pt 2 remained untreated for the entire follow-up period of 328 days. Pt 4 remained untreated for the entire follow-up period of 332 days. Pt 1 immediately initiated antiretroviral therapy... Pt 3 immediately received antiretroviral treatment.

Rationale: As evidenced for 4101 and 4102, the paper includes sequences from both ART-naive (Pt 2, Pt 4) and ART-experienced (Pt 1, Pt 3) individuals.

Answer: Yes

***

**Question: 4104**

Evidence: Pt 2 remained untreated for the entire follow-up period of 328 days. Pt 4 remained untreated for the entire follow-up period of 332 days.

Rationale: Two patients (Patient 2 and Patient 4) are explicitly stated to have remained untreated for the entire follow-up period, meaning all samples from them were from ART-naive individuals.

Answer: 2

***

**Question: 4105**

Evidence: Pt 1 immediately initiated antiretroviral therapy (tenofovir, emtricitabine, efavirenz, raltegravir) after first detection of HIV-1 plasma viremia, with raltegravir withdrawn 90 days after viral suppression. Pt 3 immediately received antiretroviral treatment (tenofovir, emtricitabine, efavirenz).

Rationale: The paper provides the initial ART regimens for Patients 1 and 3 and notes a modification for Patient 1. For Patients 2 and 4, it states they remained untreated. It does not provide a complete lifetime ART history for any patient, only their status and initial treatment within the study context.

Answer: No

***

**Question: 4201**

Evidence: The paper content does not contain a systematic analysis of the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance in a population.

Rationale: The study focuses on viral evolution and reservoir composition in a small, selected group of individuals during acute infection. It does not investigate or report on the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance in a cohort or population.

Answer: No

***

**Question: 4202**

Evidence: The paper content does not contain a systematic analysis of the prevalence of pretreatment drug resistance in a population.

Rationale: Similar to 4201, the paper's scope is the detailed virological analysis of four individuals, not a prevalence study of drug resistance in individuals initiating ART.

Answer: No

***

**Question: 4301**

Evidence: Pt 1 immediately initiated antiretroviral therapy (tenofovir, emtricitabine, efavirenz, raltegravir). Pt 3 immediately received antiretroviral treatment (tenofovir, emtricitabine, efavirenz).

Rationale: The regimens described for Patients 1 and 3 include Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs: tenofovir, emtricitabine), a Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor (NNRTIefavirenz), and an Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitor (INSTI: raltegravir for Pt 1).

Answer: NRTIs, NNRTIs, INSTIs

***

**Question: 4302**

***

**Question: 4303**

Evidence: The paper content does not contain any mention of protease inhibitors being used by the study participants.

Rationale: The ART regimens described for Patients 1 and 3 consist of NRTIs, an NNRTI, and an INSTI (for Pt 1). There is no mention of protease inhibitors being part of any treatment regimen in the study.

Answer: No

***

**Question: 4304**

Evidence: Pt 1 immediately initiated antiretroviral therapy (tenofovir, emtricitabine, efavirenz, raltegravir). Pt 3 immediately received antiretroviral treatment (tenofovir, emtricitabine, efavirenz).

Rationale: Patient 1 received a four-drug regimen that included raltegravir (an INSTI), while Patient 3 received a three-drug regimen that did not include an INSTI. Therefore, the treated individuals did not all receive the same ART.

Answer: No

***

**Question: 4305**

Evidence: Pt 1 immediately initiated antiretroviral therapy (tenofovir, emtricitabine, efavirenz, raltegravir). Pt 3 immediately received antiretroviral treatment (tenofovir, emtricitabine, efavirenz). Pt 2 remained untreated... Pt 4 remained untreated.

Rationale: Patient 1 received an INSTI (raltegravir). Patients 2 and 4 were untreated. Patient 3 was treated but did not receive an INSTI. Therefore, not all individuals were INSTI-naive; Patient 1 was INSTI-experienced.

Answer: No

***

**Question: 4403**

Evidence: The paper content does not contain information on individuals receiving more than one ART regimen.

Rationale: The paper only describes the initial ART regimens for Patients 1 and 3. For Patient 1, it mentions raltegravir was withdrawn after viral suppression, but this is a modification of the initial regimen, not a switch to a completely new regimen. There is no discussion of patients failing a regimen and switching to a second or subsequent line of therapy.

Answer: The paper does not provide this information.

***

**Question: 4404**

Evidence: The paper content does not contain information on individuals receiving more than two ART regimens.

Rationale: As with question 4403, the paper does not discuss multiple, distinct ART regimens beyond the initial treatment described.

Answer: The paper does not provide this information.

***

**Question: 4405**

Evidence: The paper content does not contain information on the number of ART regimens received by each individual.

Rationale: The paper does not provide a comparative analysis of the number of regimens per patient. It only describes the initial treatment status and regimen for each patient at the study's outset.

Answer: The paper does not provide this information.

***

**Question: 4406**

Evidence: Pt 2 remained untreated for the entire follow-up period of 328 days. Pt 4 remained untreated for the entire follow-up period of 332 days.

Rationale: Two of the four patients (Pt 2 and Pt 4) received zero ART regimens, as they remained untreated. Therefore, it is not true that all individuals received one ART regimen.

Answer: No

***

**Question: 4501**

Evidence: The paper content does not contain any mention of dolutegravir.

Rationale: A search of the paper's text finds no reference to the drug dolutegravir. The only INSTI mentioned is raltegravir.

Answer: 0

***

**Question: 4502**

Evidence: The paper content does not contain any mention of darunavir.

Rationale: A search of the paper's text finds no reference to the drug darunavir. Protease inhibitors are not mentioned in the described ART regimens.

Answer: 0

***

**Question: 5101**

Evidence: In Pt 1, whose regimen contained raltegravir from the beginning of the antiretroviral treatment initiation, a genome-intact provirus harboring a single-base substitution at 1-month post-detection translated into Y143H, an integrase inhibitor-associated resistance mutation.

Rationale: The paper reports one specific drug resistance mutation (Y143H, an INSTI-resistance mutation) in one individual (Patient 1). It does not report a systematic search for or a count of individuals with any drug resistance mutations across all drug classes.

Answer: The paper reports that 1 individual (Patient 1) was found to have a drug resistance mutation.

***

**Question: 5102**

Evidence: In Pt 1, whose regimen contained raltegravir from the beginning of the antiretroviral treatment initiation, a genome-intact provirus harboring a single-base substitution at 1-month post-detection translated into Y143H, an integrase inhibitor-associated resistance mutation.

Rationale: The paper identifies the Y143H mutation in Patient 1, which is a known INSTI-resistance mutation.

Answer: 1

***

**Question: 5103**

Evidence: The paper content does not contain any mention of TDF-resistance mutations.

Rationale: While tenofovir (TDF) was part of the regimens for Patients 1 and 3, the paper does not report any mutations associated with tenofovir resistance (e.g., K65R).

Answer: 0

***

**Question: 5104**

Evidence: In Pt 1, whose regimen contained raltegravir from the beginning of the antiretroviral treatment initiation, a genome-intact provirus harboring a single-base substitution at 1-month post-detection translated into Y143H, an integrase inhibitor-associated resistance mutation.

Rationale: The paper explicitly names "Y143H" as the integrase inhibitor-associated resistance mutation that was detected.

Answer: Y143H

***

**Question: 6101**

Evidence: The paper content does not contain any mention of phenotypic susceptibility testing.

Rationale: A thorough review of the paper finds no description of phenotypic susceptibility assays being performed. The study is entirely genotypic, using sequencing to analyze viral DNA.

Answer: The paper does not report the use of any phenotypic susceptibility test.

***

**Question: 6102**

Evidence: The paper content does not contain any mention of IC50 or IC90 values.

Rationale: As no phenotypic testing was performed, the paper does not report inhibitory concentration (IC) values like IC50 or IC90.

Answer: No

***

**Question: 6103**

Evidence: The paper content does not contain any mention of IC50 fold change values.

Rationale: As no phenotypic testing was performed, the paper does not report fold-change values.
