Question: 1101

Evidence: The study dataset was restricted to data collected by the BC-CfE between May 1996 and December 2018 inclusive, totalling 35 752 partial pol HIV sequences derived from viruses sampled from 9822 patients. All data were doubly de-identified prior to analysis.

Rationale: The paper describes a dataset of HIV sequences collected over a long period (1996-2018) and analyzed for this specific study. This constitutes previously unpublished data from this cohort for the purposes of this analysis.

"""
Question: 1104

Evidence: In BC, routine clinical care following every new HIV diagnosis includes drug resistance genotype testing performed by the BC Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS (BC-CfE). Viral RNA extracted from patient blood samples is used to determine which antiretroviral drugs will be most effective for each individual based on observed viral surveillance drug resistance mutations (SDRMs).

Rationale: The paper mentions that drug resistance genotyping is performed to determine effective antiretroviral drugs, which implies the assessment of susceptibility. However, it does not explicitly state that in vitro susceptibility data (like IC50 values) are reported.

Answer: No

Question: 2101

Evidence: Due to the confidential nature of population level HIV sequence data sets and the criminalization of HIV transmission in Canada, the HIV sequences and associated meta data will not be made publicly available.
