**Question: 1101**

Evidence: A set of 220 inhibitors were collected from literature along with their pIC ~50~ (3′- processing) values (Srivastava et al., Citation 2012 ). Chemical structure of all the selected inhibitors is given in Table S1 with their corresponding experimental pIC ~50~ values.

Rationale: The paper explicitly states that the dataset of 220 inhibitors and their experimental pIC50 values were "collected from literature" and cites a specific source (Srivastava et al., 2012). This indicates the data was previously published and is not being reported for the first time in this paper.

**Question: 1103**

Evidence: The paper does not contain any sentences describing in vitro passage experiments.

**Question: 1104**

Evidence: A set of 220 inhibitors were collected from literature along with their pIC ~50~ (3′- processing) values. We performed Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation to observe the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD), for measure the average change of displacement between the atoms for a particular frame with respect to a reference and The Root Mean Square Fluctuation (RMSF) for characterization of local changes along the protein chain of the docked complexes.

Rationale: The paper reports pIC50 values, which are a measure of inhibitory concentration (IC50) converted to a logarithmic scale (-logIC50). These values represent the potency of the inhibitors against the HIV-1 integrase enzyme in an in vitro assay, as indicated by the term "3'-processing". The MD simulations are performed on the docked complexes to further understand the interactions, but the primary susceptibility data are the pIC50 values.

Answer: Yes
