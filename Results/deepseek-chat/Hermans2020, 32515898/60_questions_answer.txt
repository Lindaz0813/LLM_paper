Question: 1101

Evidence: We performed a retrospective analysis of South African adults living with HIV experiencing failure of ritonavir-boosted-lopinavir (LPV/r)-based second-line ART for whom drug resistance testing results were available. We included patients who received plasma-based drug resistance testing at a central South African reference laboratory in 2017 and patients who received dried blood spots (DBS)-based drug resistance testing at a rural South African clinic between 2009 and 2017.

Rationale: The paper describes a retrospective analysis conducted on patient samples and data, indicating that the study reports on data collected from these patients, which would be previously unpublished findings from this specific analysis.
