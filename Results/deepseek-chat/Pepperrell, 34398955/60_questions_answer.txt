Question: 1101

Evidence: This analysis, our aim was to validate earlier published data from the ADVANCE trial that showed that participants resuppress HIV RNA on DTG-based regimens despite protocol-defined virolog- ical failure (PDVF) [4]. This is greater than the previous numbers reported in the week 96 analysis due to additional follow-up data being available [5].

Rationale: The paper explicitly states that its aim is to "validate earlier published data" from the ADVANCE trial, indicating it is building upon previously reported findings. Furthermore, it notes that the current numbers for PDVF are "greater than the previous numbers reported in the week 96 analysis due to additional follow-up data being available," confirming that it includes new, previously unpublished data.

Question: 1102

Evidence: Participants with HIV RNA ≥50 copies/mL were switched to an alternate regimen after a genotypic resistance test only if failure was confirmed according to local and WHO criteria of ≥1000 copies/mL on resampling after enhanced adherence counseling. There were 3 (TAF/FTC + DTG), 8 (TDF/FTC + DTG), and 8 (TDF/FTC/EFV) participants with PDVF who switched treatments ( Table 1 ). Only 1 participant switched from the DTG arms to ALV + TDF/FTC due to virological failure/drug resistance; 100% of participants taking TDF/FTC/EFV switched due to virological failure or drug resistance.

Rationale: The paper mentions that a "genotypic resistance test" was performed for participants meeting specific failure criteria. It also states that some participants switched treatments due to "drug resistance." However, the paper does not explicitly state that it reports the actual HIV sequences obtained from these tests. The results and tables focus on outcomes (e.g., suppression rates, reasons for switching) rather than presenting sequence data.
