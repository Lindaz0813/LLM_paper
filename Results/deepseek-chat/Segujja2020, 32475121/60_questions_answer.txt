Question: 1101

Evidence: This was a cross-sectional study conducted in an open cohort of women attending the Good Health for Women Project (GHWP)-clinic implementing HIV "test and treat" policy, between 2015 and 2018. We enrolled 267 participants, with a median age of 30 years (IQR: 26–34) and the majority (70.0%) were of primary level education. We retrieved from the biorepository, samples of consented participants and obtained from the archives their matching clinical and sociodemographic data.

Rationale: The paper describes a specific, original study conducted between 2015 and 2018 on a cohort of 267 women. It details the study design, population, setting, and methods for data and sample collection, indicating that the data being reported was collected as part of this research project and is therefore previously unpublished.
