Question: 1101

Evidence: This post-hoc analysis of the GEMINI studies demonstrates that a 2DR of dolutegravir plus lamivudine that reduces cumulative drug exposure was as potent as a standard 3DR in suppressing viral replication in PLHIV with VL up to 500,000 copies/mL. The phase III GEMINI-1 and GEMINI-2 studies demonstrated noninferior virologic ef cacy for the 2-drug regimen (2DR) dolutegravir plus lamivudine compared with the 3-drug regimen (3DR) dolutegravir plus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine xed-dose combination at week 48 for treatment-naive participants with screening HIV-1 viral load (VL) #500,000 copies/mL.

Rationale: The paper explicitly states it is performing a "post-hoc analysis" of the GEMINI-1 and GEMINI-2 studies, which were phase III trials whose primary results have been previously reported ("as previously reported"). This indicates the data being analyzed and discussed in this specific paper are from a previously conducted study, not newly collected for this publication.

Rationale: The study enrolled treatment-naive individuals, meaning they had active HIV replication at baseline as evidenced by their viral loads.
