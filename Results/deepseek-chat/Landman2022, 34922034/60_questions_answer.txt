Question: 1101

Evidence: This was a multicenter, longitudinal, observational study with retrospective patient enrolment. Patients were enrolled between February 2017 and January 2018. Patients starting dolutegravir treatment between February 2014 and September 2016 were retrospectively included.

Rationale: The paper describes the COPEDOL study, which is an observational study conducted in France. The methods section explicitly states that it involved "retrospective patient enrolment" and that patients starting treatment between 2014 and 2016 were "retrospectively included," while enrolment occurred in 2017-2018. This indicates the study analyzed pre-existing, previously collected data, meaning it reports previously unpublished data from this specific study.

Answer: Yes
"""

"""
Question: 1102

Evidence: At inclusion, 179 of 349 patients tested (51.3%) presented at least one resistance mutation for nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). Five patients acquired DTG resistance mutations (five patients taking DTG 50 mg once a day and one patient taking DTG 50 mg twice a day).

Rationale: The paper reports on the prevalence of resistance mutations for various drug classes (NRTIs, NNRTIs, PIs, INSTIs) at baseline and the emergence of new DTG resistance mutations during the study. The identification and listing of specific resistance mutations (e.g., in Table 4) implies that HIV genotypic sequencing was performed to detect these mutations.

Question: 2202

Evidence: Individual patients could present multiple mutations. Resistance mutations were defined according to the ANRS classification algorithm [6]. Mutations present in more patients at the end of the study period than at inclusion are listed in bold.

Rationale: Table 4 in the paper is titled "Identification of dolutegravir resistance mutations." It lists specific mutations (e.g., V151L, R263K, E92Q+N155H, Q148H/K/R) and indicates the number of patients in which each mutation was found, both at inclusion and at the end of the study.

Evidence: Resistance mutations for nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) were detected in 154/350 tested patients (44.0%) and resistance mutations for protease inhibitors (PIs) in 139/349 tested patients (39.8%). Nine out of 150 patients (6%) presented a DTG resistance mutation before starting the DTG regimen.

Rationale: The paper reports resistance mutations associated with different drug classes: Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitors (INSTIs, like DTG), Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs), Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTIs), and Protease Inhibitors (PIs). This indicates that at least the pol gene, which contains the reverse transcriptase, protease, and integrase regions, was sequenced.
