Question: 1101

Evidence: This is a retrospective observational study performed on the Antiviral Response Cohort Analysis (ARCA) database, which contains data on HIV resistance and ART from more than 40 000 patients in Italy. We collected HIV routine care data from different Italian clinical centres to compare the eﬃcacy of DTG-based 2DR and 3DR according to baseline drug resistance.

Rationale: The paper explicitly states that it is a "retrospective observational study" using data from the ARCA database and that it "collected HIV routine care data from different Italian clinical centres." This indicates the data were collected from existing clinical records and databases, not generated specifically for this study, suggesting the data were previously collected, though the analysis and presentation of these specific findings may be new.

The results mention that among patients with VF, "GRT after VF was performed in five patients... but none of them showed the emergence of new resistance mutations in the PR-RT and IN regions compared to pre-baseline GRT." This implies that sequencing was performed on virus from plasma, as this is the standard source for detecting emerging resistance after VF.

Rationale: While the specific source (plasma vs. PBMC) for the pre-baseline genotypes is not explicitly stated, the standard of care for resistance testing in virologically suppressed patients is often based on historical plasma genotypes.
