Question: 1101

Evidence: A cross-sectional analysis of study enrollment data from the Project YES! Youth Engaging for Success randomized controlled trial was conducted. We thus analyzed baseline study enrollment data collected through a randomized controlled trial entitled “Project YES! Youth Engaging for Success” in order to determine the prevalence and characteristics of HIV drug resistance among ART- experienced youth, aged 15 to 24 years, attending four HIV care clinics in Ndola, Zambia.
