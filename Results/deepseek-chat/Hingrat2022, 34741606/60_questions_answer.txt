Question: 1101

Evidence: The aim of this study was to complete INSTI resistance data on HIV-2 by determining the viral replicative capacity and INSTI phenotypic susceptibility of integrase mutants harbouring ins231 obtained through site-directed mutagenesis. These first data on the newly described resistance pathway 231ins, using site-directed mutagenesis, showed no measurable impact on viral fitness and confirmed the decreased susceptibility to a first-generation INSTI (raltegravir) and cabotegravir.

Rationale: The paper explicitly states its aim is to "complete INSTI resistance data" and refers to "these first data on the newly described resistance pathway 231ins," indicating it presents previously unpublished findings from their site-directed mutagenesis experiments.
