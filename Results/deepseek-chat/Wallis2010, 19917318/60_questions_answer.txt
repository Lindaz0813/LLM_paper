Question: 1101

Evidence: This study focuses on the development and validation of an HIV-1 subtype C specific genotypic drug resistance assay for use in South African patients failing HAART. Ninety plasma samples were obtained from patients samples sent for routine HIV-1 drug resistance testing (viral load >1000 RNA copies/ml) and were used to validate the “in-house” drug resistance assay. In addition, 10 samples from external quality assurance panels obtained from the National Institutes of Health Virology Quality Assurance (VQA) Laboratory, USA were used to validate the “in-house” method.

Rationale: The paper describes a specific study involving the development and validation of a new assay, using patient samples and external panels. This constitutes the reporting of new, previously unpublished data collected and analyzed by the authors.

Answer: Yes
"""

"""
Question: 1102

Evidence: The ViroSeq and “in-house” sequences were generated at different time points and phylogenetic tree analysis was performed to ensure there was no cross-contamination of samples. The “in-house” sequence data were submitted to the Stanford Database to generate an HIV-1 drug resistance report and to determine subtype, as described previously.

Rationale: The paper explicitly states that sequences were generated from patient samples using both the ViroSeq and the in-house assay. The generation and analysis of these sequences is a central part of the study.

Answer: Yes

Question: 1103

Evidence: The paper does not describe any experiments where HIV was passaged in cell culture in the presence or absence of drugs to select for resistance.

Rationale: After a thorough review of the entire paper content, there is no mention of in vitro passage experiments. The study focuses on genotypic resistance testing from clinical samples.

Answer: No
"""

"""
Question: 1104

Evidence: The paper does not report any data on the concentration of drug required to inhibit viral replication in a cell culture assay.

Rationale: The entire methodology and results section is dedicated to genotypic (sequence-based) resistance testing. There is no description of phenotypic susceptibility testing, which measures viral growth inhibition in the presence of drugs.

Question: 2202

Evidence: The drug resistance profiles generated for these nine patient samples indicated that 78% (n = 7) had mutations that would result in resistance to both nucleoside and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, indicating the importance of analyzing successfully these samples. Seventy-six of the 81 samples were found to have identical mutation profiles generated by the two HIV-1 drug resistance assays.

"""

"""
Question: 2302

Evidence: The subtype distribution was as expected with 96.7% (n = 87) of the samples being classified as HIV-1 subtype C. Two of the three remaining samples were classified as HIV-1 subtype B and one as subtype A. Subtype analysis revealed that the subtype distribution was 53% subtype C (n = 138), 29% subtype A1 (n = 76), 9% subtype D (n = 23), 1% subtype B (n = 3) and 8% were unassigned (n = 20).

Rationale: The paper provides detailed subtype distributions for two different sample sets: the 90 validation samples (predominantly subtype C, with some B and A) and the 295 African site samples (C, A1, D, B, and unassigned).

Answer: Subtype C, Subtype B, Subtype A, Subtype A1, Subtype D

Question: 2303

Evidence: Most genotyping methods detect HIV drug resistance by sequencing the protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) regions of the pol gene. Complete sequences encompassing the pol region of interest were assembled and manually edited using Sequencher version 4.7 (Genecodes, MI, USA).

Rationale: The paper explicitly states that the genotyping assays sequence the protease and reverse transcriptase regions, which are parts of the pol gene.

Answer: pol (protease and reverse transcriptase regions)

"""
Question: 2304

Evidence: Most genotyping methods detect HIV drug resistance by sequencing the protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) regions of the pol gene. The use of only 5 primers to generate a fully bidirectional sequence with coverage of PR 1-99 and RT 1-240 increases the number of samples that can be sequenced on one 96 well plate.
