**Question: 1101**

Evidence: These results were presented in part at the 2020 Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI), March 2020, Virtual and at the 2021 Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI), March 2021. Here we assessed the impact of pre-existing drug resistance substitutions on treatment outcomes and emergent resistance in an integrated analysis of both studies.

Rationale: The paper explicitly states that the results were "presented in part" at conferences in 2020 and 2021. This indicates that the data has been previously presented, and therefore this paper is not the first disclosure of this data, meaning it does not report *previously unpublished* data in the strictest sense.

Answer: No

---

**Question: 1102**

Evidence: Population sequencing of HIV-1 protease and reverse transcriptase (RT) was performed at screening. Retrospective baseline next generation sequencing of protease, RT and integrase (IN) was analysed at a 15% cutoff.

Rationale: The paper describes the methods used for sequencing the HIV-1 genome, specifically the protease, reverse transcriptase, and integrase genes. Reporting the results of these sequencing efforts constitutes reporting HIV sequences.

Answer: Yes

---

**Question: 1103**

Evidence: Both bictegravir and dolutegravir have demonstrated a high barrier to resistance in vitro, and when combined with two NRTIs, each maintained durable suppression of HIV-1 with or without certain drug resistance substitutions in treatment-naive participants in clinical trials, with no emergence of resistance in cases of virological failure.

Rationale: The paper references *in vitro* barrier to resistance data from other studies but does not describe conducting its own *in vitro* passage experiments. The study itself is a clinical trial analysis.

Answer: No

---

**Question: 1104**

Evidence: For post-baseline resistance analyses of participants in the RAP, the failure and baseline samples had PR, RT, and integrase (IN) population genotyping and phenotyping performed at Monogram Biosciences.

Rationale: The paper states that phenotyping was performed on samples from the resistance analysis population. Phenotypic susceptibility testing provides *in vitro* antiretroviral susceptibility data.

Answer: Yes

---

**Question: 2101**

Evidence: [No sentences from the provided text mention GenBank accession numbers.]

Rationale: After a thorough review of the entire paper content, including the methods, results, and supplementary tables, there is no mention of GenBank or any other accession numbers for the sequenced HIV isolates.

Answer: No

---

**Question: 2102**

**Question: 2202**

Evidence: Retrospective baseline next generation sequencing of protease, RT and integrase (IN) was analysed at a 15% cutoff. Primary INSTI resistance substitutions were infrequent and were observed in 1.3% (17/1270) of participants (Table 1 ); they consisted of the polymorphic T97A mutation ( *n =* 16) and the bictegravir and dolutegravir resistance substitutions Q148H with G140S ( *n =* 1).

Rationale: The paper reports the specific mutations found in individuals, such as T97A and Q148H+G140S, and provides detailed tables (Table 1 and Table 2) listing the prevalence of various mutations across the participant groups. This constitutes reporting lists of mutations for individual sequenced isolates, albeit in an aggregated format.

Answer: Yes

---

**Question: 2301**

Evidence: The clinical studies in treatment-naive participants GS-US-380-1489 (Study 1489) and GS-US-380-1490 (Study 1490) are 144 week Phase 3 studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of B/F/TAF in HIV-1-infected adults.

Rationale: The paper exclusively refers to HIV-1 throughout the text and does not mention HIV-2 or any other HIV species.

Answer: HIV-1

---

Answer: No

---

**Question: 2601**

Evidence: [No sentences from the provided text explicitly state the source of the sequenced virus, but the context of measuring HIV-1 RNA and virological failure strongly implies plasma was the source.] The sample from the confirmation visit was analysed for resistance development if the HIV-1 RNA value was ≥200 copies/mL.

Rationale: The resistance analysis was triggered by a plasma HIV-1 RNA value ≥200 copies/mL, and the sample from that visit was used for sequencing. This standard practice implies the sequencing was performed on plasma virus.

Answer: Yes

---

**Question: 2602**

Evidence: [No sentences from the provided text mention sequencing from PBMCs.]

Rationale: The paper focuses on virological failure and plasma HIV-1 RNA levels. There is no mention of sequencing from PBMCs or the proviral DNA reservoir.

Answer: No

---
