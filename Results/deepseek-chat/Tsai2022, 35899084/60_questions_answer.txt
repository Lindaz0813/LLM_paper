Question: 1101

Evidence: This retrospective cohort study enrolled individuals residing in southern Taiwan, who were infected with HIV-1 and failed treatment with an NNRTI-based STR from 2015 to 2020. A total of 107 patients were included, of whom 29 were treatment failure to the initial STRs, and 78 failed treatment after switching to an STR.

Rationale: The paper describes a specific, original study conducted by the authors, enrolling patients from 2015 to 2020 and reporting new findings from their analysis. This constitutes previously unpublished data.

Question: 1102

Evidence: ViroSeq HIV-1 Genotyping System version v2.8 (Celera, Alameda, CA, USA) was used to test resistance for PR/RT ( *pol* gene), and in-house sequencing was used to test resistance to integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) ( *pol* gene). Sanger sequencing successfully identified the PR/RT (n=107) and INSTI (n=12) regions in all cases.
