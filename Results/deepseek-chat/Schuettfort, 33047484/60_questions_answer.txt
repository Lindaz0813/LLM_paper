Question: 1101

Evidence: We conducted a retrospective, multicentre analysis including people diagnosed with HIV infection with a CD4 cell count < 200 cells/µL and/or an AIDS-defining condition who started ART at one of five European HIV treatment centres based in Frankfurt (Germany), Madrid (Spain) and London (England). All individuals were aged > 18 years, diagnosed as HIV positive with a CD4 cell count < 200 cells/µL and/or an AIDS-defining condition, and started ART for the first time from 1 st of January 2014 to 31 st of December 2016; those starting ART regimens including either an INI or a PI were included in this study.

Rationale: The paper describes a new, original study conducted by the authors, analyzing data from a specific patient population (late presenters) over a defined time period (2014-2016). It is not a review or meta-analysis of previously published data.
