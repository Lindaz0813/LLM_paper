Up to May 2008, more than 6000 patients received combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). As HIV drug resistance is the major obstacle for effective treatment, the purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of antiretroviral drug resistance in Honduran HIV-1-infected individuals.\\n\\n### Methods\\n\\nWe collected samples from 138 individuals (97 adults and 41 children) on cART with virological, immunological or clinical signs of treatment failure. HIV-1 *pol* sequences were obtained using an in-house method. Resistance mutations were identified according to the 2007 International AIDS Society (IAS)-USA list and predicted susceptibility to cART was scored using the anrs algorithm.\\n\\n### Results\\n\\nResistance mutations were detected in 112 patients (81%), 74% in adults and 98% in children. Triple-, dual- and single-class drug resistance was documented in 27%, 43% and 11% of the study subjects, respectively. Multiple logistic regression showed that resistance was independently associated with type of treatment failure \\\\[virological failure (odds ratio (OR)=1) *vs* . immunological failure (OR=0.11; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.030--0.43) *vs* . clinical failure (OR=0.037; 95% CI 0.0063--0.22)\\\\], route of transmission (OR=42.8; 95% CI 3.73--491), and years on therapy (OR=1.81; 95% CI 1.11--2.93).\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nThe prevalence of antiretroviral resistance was high in Honduran HIV-infected patients with signs of treatment failure. A majority of study subjects showed dual- or triple-class resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors. Virologically defined treatment failure was a strong predictor of resistance, indicating that viral load testing is needed to correctly identify patients with treatment failure attributable to resistance.\\n\\n::: section\\n\\n\\n## Materials and methods\\n\\n### Patients\\n\\nPatients were invited to participate in the study by their medical\\ndoctors. After they had consented, whole blood was collected in BD\\nVacutainer ^®^ Cell Preparation Tubes (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes,\\nNJ, USA) to obtain plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells\\n(PBMCs). The study samples were collected between June 2004 and April\\n2007. Our patients were selected from the two major medical facilities\\nin the country, Instituto Nacional del Tórax in Tegucigalpa and Hospital\\nMario Catarino Rivas in San Pedro Sula, but are likely to be\\nrepresentative of patients failing cART in the country. The inclusion\\ncriterion was signs of treatment failure after more than 6 months of\\ntherapy. Treatment failure was divided into three hierarchical\\ncategories (virological, immunological and clinical treatment failure)\\nbecause access to plasma HIV-1 RNA and CD4 T-lymphocyte quantification\\nwas irregular during the study period. Thus, virological treatment\\nfailure was defined as plasma viral load (VL) \\\\>1000\\u2003copies/mL (VL\\ndetermined a maximum of 6 months prior to the resistance test). For\\npatients who did not fulfil the criteria for virological treatment\\nfailure, immunological treatment failure was defined as CD4\\n\\\\<250\\u2003cells/μL (CD4 count determined a maximum of 6 months prior to the\\nresistance test). For patients who did not fulfil the criteria for\\nvirological or immunological treatment failure, clinical treatment\\nfailure was defined as the development of opportunistic infection or\\nother clinical symptoms indicating disease progression.\\n\\nThe ethics committee at the National Autonomous University of Honduras\\nand the Regional Medical Ethics Board in Stockholm, Sweden approved the\\nstudy (Dnr. 21/2007-77).\\n\\n### Measurements of plasma HIV-1 RNA levels and CD4 cell counts\\n\\nPlasma HIV-1 RNA levels (VL) were measured using an Amplicor HIV-1\\nmonitor system (Roche, Rotkreuz, Switzerland) or the Real-Time PCR HIV-1\\nsystem (Abbott Laboratories, Des Plaines, IL). CD4 cell counts were\\nmeasured using the Dynal ^®^ T4 Quant Kit (Dynal Biotech ASA, Oslo,\\nNorway).\\n\\n### Estimation of adherence\\n\\nAdherence to HIV therapy was scored as good, intermediate or poor by\\nself-reporting by the patients in face-to-face interviews during\\nordinary clinical visits and from the medical records. The scoring\\nsystem has been established by the Ministry of Health in Honduras\\nfollowing the Spanish recommendations \\\\[ 13 \\\\]. Thus, adherence was\\nscored as good when the patients reported having missed fewer than three\\ndoses in the last month; intermediate when three to 12 doses had been\\nmissed, and poor when more than 12 doses had been missed.\\n\\n### Genotypic HIV-1 resistance testing\\n\\nBlood samples (10--20\\u2003mL of sodium citrate-treated whole blood) for\\ngenotypic resistance testing were collected in Honduras. Plasma and\\nPBMCs were separated in a polyester gel and a density gradient liquid\\n(BD Vacutainer ^™^ CPT ^™^ Tube) and stored at −80\\u2003°C in Honduras before\\nshipment to Sweden for genotypic resistance testing.\\n\\nResistance testing was carried out on plasma RNA or PBMC DNA using an\\nin-house method. Briefly, RNA or DNA was extracted from plasma or PBMCs\\nusing the QIAmp RNA or DNA kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The RNA was\\nused to generate cDNA, whereas the DNA was directly used for polymerase\\nchain reaction (PCR). A nested PCR for the *pol* gene was performed for\\nsequencing using a reaction mixture and cycling conditions as described\\npreviously \\\\[ 14 \\\\], with some modification of primers. The PCR primers\\nwere JA269 (outer forward AGGAAGGACACCARATGAARGA), JA272 (outer reverse\\nGGATAAATCTGA CTTGCCCART), JA270 (inner forward GCTTCCCTCARATCACTCTT) and\\nJA271 (inner reverse CCACTAAYTTCTGTATRTCATTGAC). The sequencing primers\\nwere JA273 (outer forward CCCTCAAATCACTCTTTGGC), JA274 (inner forward\\nAAAATC CATACAATACTCCA), JA275 (inner reverse TTATTGAGTTCTCTGAAATC) and\\nJA276 (outer reverse TGTATATCATTGACAGTCCA). DNA sequencing was performed\\non an ABI Prism ^™^ 3100 Genetic Analyser (Applied Biosystems,\\nStockholm, Sweden). The sequence fragments were assembled and analysed\\nusing the software program sequencher ^™^ (Gene Codes Corporation, Ann\\nArbor, MI, USA). The HIV-1 *pol* sequences have been submitted to\\nGenBank under accession numbers FJ800379--FJ800386, FJ800388--FJ800438,\\nFJ800440--FJ800505 and FJ823645--FJ823657.\\n\\nMajor and minor resistance mutations according to the 2007 list of the\\nInternational AIDS Society--USA Panel Guidelines \\\\[ 9 \\\\] were identified\\nusing the Stanford hivdb program ( http://hivdb.stanford.edu ). The\\npredicted susceptibilities of the viruses to NRTIs, NNRTIs and PIs were\\nestimated using the ANRS algorithm (July 2008, version 17;\\nhttp://www.medpocket.com ). The resistance profiles were used together\\nwith clinical data and other laboratory data to provide individualized\\nexpert advice on possible treatment modifications, taking into account\\nthe fact that some registered antiretroviral drugs are not available in\\nHonduras.\\n\\nThe *pol* gene sequences and recommended subtype reference sequences (\\nhttp://www.hiv.lanl.gov ) were also used to construct neighbour-joining\\nphylogenetic trees using the mega 4 software \\\\[ 15 \\\\]. Phylogenetic tree\\nanalysis was used to determine the subtype of the *pol* gene sequence\\nand to facilitate detection of possible PCR contamination and sample\\nmix-up.\\n\\n### Statistical methods\\n\\nThe prevalence of drug resistance mutations was calculated with a 95%\\nconfidence interval (CI) based on the binomial distribution. Univariable\\nand multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to estimate\\nodds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs for the association between resistance\\nstatus and various factors. Statistical analyses were carried out using\\nstatistica version 8.0 (StatSoft Inc., Tulsa, OK, USA) and stata version\\n8.2 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA).\\n\\n::: section\\n\\n## Results\\n\\nA total of 138 HIV-1-infected individuals with treatment failure were\\nincluded in the study ( Table 2 ); 97 were adults and 41 were children\\nunder 18 years of age. A little more than half of the study subjects\\nwere male (57%). The median age was 38 years for the adults and 10 years\\nfor the children. All individuals were native Hondurans; the most\\nfrequent route of transmission was heterosexual transmission (66%),\\nfollowed by mother-to-child transmission (28%), blood products (3%) and\\nhomosexual transmission (3%). The severity of disease according to the\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Classification System\\n\\\\[ 16 \\\\] was stage A for 12 patients, stage B for 60 patients and stage\\nC for 66 patients. Adherence was scored as good in 99 patients (72%),\\nintermediate in 26 patients (19%) and poor in 13 patients (9%). The\\nmedian time on antiretroviral therapy was 3.2 years (range 1--12 years).\\nThe median CD4 count was 185\\u2003cells/μL and the median VL was 4.5\\u2003log ~10~\\ncopies/mL ( Table 2 ). The median time span between sampling for the\\nresistance test and the last available CD4 cell count was 5 months\\n(range 0--36 months); one patient had never undergone CD4 cell count\\nmeasurements. The median time span between the last VL measurement and\\nsampling for resistance was 5 months (range 0--25 months); seven\\npatients had never undergone VL testing. Only 37 patients (28%) had CD4\\ncell counts and VL determined simultaneously with the resistance test.\\n\\n\\nThe patients were recruited using three different criteria for treatment\\nfailure (virological, immunological and clinical) because access to\\nplasma HIV-1 RNA and CD4 quantification was irregular during the study\\nperiod. Table 2 shows that 51% of the treatment failures were identified\\nvirologically, 21% immunologically and 28% clinically.\\n\\nAt the time of sampling for resistance testing, 50% of the patients were\\nreceiving two NRTIs+one NNRTI, 47% were receiving two NRTIs+one PI, and\\n3% were receiving triple-class therapy (one NRTI+one NNRTI+one PI). The\\nmost common drug combinations were: zidovudine+lamivudine+efavirenz (40\\npatients), stavudine+lamivudine+nelfinavir (13 patients),\\nstavudine+lamivudine+nevirapine (12 patients), and\\nzidovudine+lamivudine+indinavir (nine patients).\\n\\nGenotyping of HIV resistance was performed in all 138 study subjects\\nusing an in-house resistance assay. As described in the Materials and\\nMethods and for logistical reasons (i.e. safe transport of high-quality\\nsamples to Sweden), the majority of the sequences were obtained from\\nPBMCs, whereas 42 resistance tests were performed using both PBMC DNA\\nand plasma RNA. We compared the mutational resistance patterns in plasma\\nand PBMCs for these 42 patients and observed a high concordance (data\\nnot shown). Thus, 97% of the observed resistance mutations were\\nconcordantly detected in plasma and PBMCs. All *pol* sequences were of\\nHIV-1 genetic subtype B. We did not find any unexpected close clustering\\nor identical sequences, which indicates that we did not experience\\nproblems with PCR contamination.\\n\\nAt least one major drug resistance mutation was documented in 112 of the\\n138 patients (81%; 95% CI 79--91%) ( Table 2 ). Resistance was more\\ncommon in the samples from children (98%; 95% CI 87--99) than in those\\nfrom adults (74%; 95% CI 64--82) ( *P* =0.011). Resistance was also\\nstrongly related to route of transmission ( *P* =0.010), which was not\\nunexpected given the significant difference between adults and children.\\nResistance was significantly more prevalent in patients in whom\\ntreatment failure had been identified virologically as compared with\\nimmunologically ( *P* \\\\<0.001) or clinically ( *P* =0.019).\\n\\nOf the study subjects, 80 patients (58%) had started treatment after\\n2002 within the frame of the National HIV/AIDS cART Program and thus\\nshould have received triple combination therapy in a systematic way.\\nSixty of these patients (75%) displayed drug resistance mutations after\\na median time on cART of 2.6 years. There were 58 study subjects (42%)\\nwho had begun therapy before 2002 (before the start of the National\\nHIV/AIDS Program); they had a median time on ART of 6 years, and 52 of\\nthem (90%) showed drug resistance mutations. Of these patients, 52% had\\nstarted with mono or dual therapy, whereas 48% had been started on a\\ntriple combination, but as described below almost all had had\\ndiscontinuous ART and many treatment changes. Start of therapy before or\\nwithin the national treatment programme was significantly associated\\nwith the prevalence of resistance ( *P* =0.035). Resistance was also\\nstrongly correlated to years on therapy ( *P* =0.001).\\n\\nThe patients had received a median of two (range one to six) different\\nART regimens ( Table 2 ). Resistance was positively correlated with the\\nnumber of treatment changes ( *P* =0.005). Thus, resistance was\\ndocumented in 20 of 30 patients (67%) who were on their first regimen\\n*vs* . 15 of 15 patients (100%) who had undergone at least five\\ntreatment changes. Only 22% of the patients remained on first-line\\ntherapy. The remaining patients had undergone one or several treatment\\nchanges. The majority of these treatment changes (49%) were made\\nrationally (e.g. because of suspected treatment failure or drug\\ntoxicity), in 12% of the cases the treatment changes were irrational\\n(e.g. because of cost or interrupted drug supplies) and 17% of the\\nchanges involved treatment interruption (often because of cost or\\ninterrupted drug supplies) ( Table 2 ). CDC stage and self-reported\\nadherence levels were not significantly correlated to resistance,\\nwhereas CD4 cell counts and plasma HIV RNA levels were significantly\\ncorrelated to resistance. However, it should be pointed out that these\\nCD4 and HIV RNA levels frequently were not obtained concomitantly with\\nthe resistance test and often not even while the patient was on the same\\ntherapy as when the resistance test was carried out.\\n\\nMultiple logistic regression was used to identify variables that were\\nindependently associated with the presence of genotypic resistance. The\\nfinal model includes as categorical variables: route of infection, start\\nof therapy within the national treatment programme (yes/no) and type of\\nvirological failure (virological, immunological or clinical). Number of\\ntreatment changes and years on therapy were included as continuous\\nvariables. Age (adult *vs* . child) was not included as a variable\\nbecause it largely overlapped with route of infection. CD4 cell counts\\nand HIV RNA were not included because results were not available for all\\npatients and often were obtained long before the sample used for\\nresistance testing. The multivariable analysis identified the following\\nvariables as independently associated with resistance: type of treatment\\nfailure \\\\[virological failure (OR=1) *vs* . immunological failure\\n(OR=0.11; 95% CI 0.030--0.43) *vs* . clinical failure (OR=0.037; 95% CI\\n0.0063--0.22)\\\\]; route of transmission (OR=42.8; 95% CI 3.73--491); and\\nyears on therapy (OR=1.81; 95% CI 1.11--2.93). This indicates that VL\\ntesting was needed to correctly identify patients with treatment failure\\nattributable to resistance.\\n\\nAs shown in Table 3 , genotypes predicted to have reduced susceptibility\\nto at least one NRTI were observed in 98 of 138 patients (71%; 95% CI\\n63--78%); to at least one NNRTI in 96 patients (70%; 95% CI 61--77%);\\nand to at least one PI in 51 patients (37%; 95% CI 29--45%). Dual and\\ntriple class resistance was very common. Thus, triple-class drug\\nresistance was documented in 37 of the 138 study subjects (27%; 95% CI\\n20--35%) and dual-class drug resistance was detected in 59 patients\\n(43%; 95% CI 34--51%), whereas only 16 (12%; 95% CI 7--18) of the\\npatients showed single-class resistance.\\n\\n\\n\\nDuring their treatment history, 45 patients had received treatment with\\ntwo classes of drug (NRTIs+NNRTIs); 15 of these patients did not display\\nresistance, four had resistance to one class of drug (three to NNRTIs\\nand one to NRTIs), 25 had two-class resistance (24 to NRTIs+NNRTIs and\\none to NRTIs+PIs), and one patient had three-class resistance\\n(NRTIs+NNRTIs+PIs). Ninety-three patients had taken at least one PI in\\ntheir treatments: 11 of them showed no resistance; 12 displayed\\nresistance to one class of drug (eight to NNRTIs, two to NRTIs and two\\nto PIs); 34 patients showed resistance to two classes of drug (23 to\\nNRTIs+NNRTIs, 10 to NRTIs+PIs and one to NNRTIs+PIs), and 37 showed\\nresistance to three classes of drug.\\n\\nFigure 1 shows the resistance mutations that were observed in the study\\npopulation. At least one thymidine-associated mutation (TAM), that is a\\nmutation at position 41, 67, 210, 215 or 219 in RT, was seen in 60% of\\npatients, and the lamivudine/emtricitabine resistance mutation M184I/V\\nwas observed in 62% of the patients. Multi-nucleoside resistance\\nmutations, such as Q151M, were rare and such a mutation was only\\nobserved in one patient. The K103N mutation was the most frequently\\nobserved (30%) of the NNRTI resistance mutations. A smaller proportion\\nof the study subjects (32%) had at least one major PI resistance\\nmutation; for example, a mutation at position 30, 46, 82, 84, 88 or 90\\nof PR.\\n\\n::: section\\n\\n## Discussion\\n\\nThe present study describes the prevalence of genotypic resistance to\\nantiretroviral drugs in clinical samples from 138 Honduran patients who\\nwere failing ART. It was found that the prevalence of resistance was\\nhigh (81%) in our study population. Thus, resistance to at least one\\ndrug class was found in 11% of the patients, dual class resistance was\\nfound in 43% of the patients and triple class resistance was found in\\n27% of the patients. The proportion of individuals with resistance was\\nhigher among children (98%) than among adults (74%). The type of\\ntreatment failure (virological, immunological or clinical) was the\\nstrongest predictor of resistance, but route of transmission and years\\non therapy were also independently associated with the presence of\\ngenotypic resistance.\\n\\nOur study revealed that there are considerable problems with resistance\\nto antiretroviral drugs in Honduras. However, it is important to stress\\nthat our results do not reflect the prevalence of resistance among all\\nHIV-infected patients in Honduras, because the study subjects were\\nselected on the basis of treatment failure. Nevertheless, it is worrying\\nthat dual- and triple-class resistance was very common. Furthermore, we\\nobserved that treatment changes were common and associated with a higher\\nprevalence of resistance, as was years on therapy.\\n\\nOur review of the patient records revealed that many of the treatment\\nchanges were not driven by laboratory results indicating treatment\\nfailure, primarily because access to plasma HIV-1 RNA and CD4\\nquantification was irregular during the study period. Instead, treatment\\nchanges had often been initiated as a consequence of clinical\\nprogression or interrupted access to specific antiretroviral drugs.\\nThus, the resistance problems in our study population appear in part to\\nbe attributable to limited and interrupted access to treatment, but also\\ninvolve problems with adherence and the prior use of mono and dual\\ntherapy. Importantly, the definition of treatment failure (virological,\\nimmunological or clinical) was the strongest predictor of resistance.\\nImmunological and clinical treatment failure were categorised as\\ninclusion criteria because access to plasma HIV-1 RNA and CD4\\nquantification was irregular during the study period. The finding that\\nimmunological and clinical criteria were poor predictors of treatment\\nfailure attributable to resistance is important and has relevance for\\nother resource-poor settings where access to VL testing may be limited.\\nOur results are in agreement with recent data which also show that CD4\\ncell counts and clinical criteria do not accurately identify patients\\nwith virological treatment failure \\\\[ 17--19 \\\\].\\n\\nIn this study, we estimated that the overall prevalence of\\nresistance-associated mutations was 81% among the investigated Honduran\\npatients, who were selected on the basis of signs and symptoms of\\ntreatment failure. This finding agrees well with results from the United\\nKingdom (80% resistance) \\\\[ 10 \\\\], United States (76% resistance) \\\\[ 11\\n\\\\], and France (88% resistance) \\\\[ 12 \\\\], in spite of the fact that the\\ncART conditions in these countries are very different from those in\\nHonduras. It is somewhat surprising that 19% of the 138 studied patients\\ndid not appear to harbour a resistant virus even though they had been\\nselected as experiencing treatment failure. The absence of resistance in\\n19% of the patients indicates that adherence in these patients may have\\nbeen too low to drive the development of resistance. However, and as\\ndiscussed above, the significant association of resistance with type of\\nfailure (virological, immunological or clinical) also demonstrates that\\nit is difficult to monitor HIV therapy without regular access to plasma\\nHIV-1 quantification. Thus, patients with adequate adherence and low\\nplasma HIV RNA levels may incorrectly have been perceived to have\\nimmunological or clinical treatment failure.\\n\\nWe observed that the presence of genotypic resistance was positively\\ncorrelated with years on therapy and the number of ART regimens used.\\nWhen this study was carried out, access in Honduras to boosted PIs was\\nvery limited. The broad resistance to NRTIs, NNRTIs and unboosted PIs\\nindicates that many of our study subjects were in need of salvage\\ntherapy with boosted PIs as well as entry and integrase inhibitors \\\\[ 3\\n\\\\]. Improved access to these drugs is urgently needed for these and\\nother heavily treatment-experienced Honduran patients. M184V and K103N\\nwere the most prevalent NRTI and NNRTI mutations in our study, at 62%\\nand 30%, respectively. M184V causes high-level (\\\\>100-fold) resistance\\nto lamivudine/emtricitabine and emerges rapidly in patients who receive\\nlamivudine monotherapy \\\\[ 20 \\\\]. It is also the first mutation to\\ndevelop in patients receiving partially suppressive triple combination\\ntherapy including lamivudine \\\\[ 21--23 \\\\]. K103N is the most clinically\\nimportant NNRTI resistance mutation. It causes 20- to 50-fold resistance\\nto the most available NNRTIs, which is sufficient to cause virological\\nfailure \\\\[ 24,25 \\\\]. It was not surprising to find a high frequency of\\nthe K103N mutation because of the common use of NNRTIs in Honduras and\\nthe ability of the virus to develop NNRTI resistance mutations during\\nmonotherapy and during incomplete viral suppression \\\\[ 25 \\\\].\\n\\nSome limitations of our analysis should be mentioned. The patients were\\nclassified as failing their current cART based on virological,\\nimmunological, and/or clinical data; but some patients may incorrectly\\nhave been classified as failing their current regimen because access to\\nlaboratory monitoring is limited in Honduras. Furthermore, for\\nlogistical reasons (i.e. safe transport of high-quality samples to\\nSweden), only 42 resistance tests were performed using plasma samples\\nand the remaining sequences were obtained from PBMCs. We compared the\\nmutational resistance patterns in plasma and PBMCs for these 42 patients\\nand observed a high concordance. Similar results have been shown in\\nother studies \\\\[ 26--28 \\\\]. Thus, we feel that it is unlikely that our\\nfindings have been significantly affected by the fact that most\\nresistance tests were carried out on PBMC DNA. Another potential\\nlimitation of our study is that it is difficult to precisely estimate\\nthe representativeness of our study population with regard to all\\npatients failing ART in Honduras because there is no reliable\\ninformation about how many patients have successful *vs* . failing\\nfirst- or second-line therapy.\\n\\nIn conclusion, we have documented a high prevalence of resistance to\\nantiretroviral drugs in this sample of antiretroviral-treated adult and\\npaediatric HIV-infected patients in Honduras. Most of the treatment\\nfailures observed in these patients can be attributed to the previous\\nuse of mono and dual therapy and to limited and interrupted access to\\nantiretroviral drugs in this country. Irregular access to CD4 and VL\\ntesting is an additional problem. Similarly, there is a need to\\nestablish access to routine resistance testing in Honduras, and this is\\none of the overall aims of the bilateral collaboration between Honduras\\nand Sweden. In our study, virological failure was the strongest\\npredictor of resistance. This suggests that plasma HIV RNA\\nquantification may be clinically beneficial and cost effective through\\npreventing unnecessary treatment changes. Thus, the management of these\\nheavily treatment-experienced HIV-infected patients represents a\\nconsiderable challenge for HIV clinicians in Honduras. There is an\\nurgent need for improved and sustainable access to antiretroviral drugs,\\nincluding boosted PIs, newly introduced NNRTIs, and entry and integrase\\ninhibitors, as well as VL, CD4 and resistance testing.\\n\\n\\n```\\n\\n## Questions:\\n\\nDoes the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?\\n'}\n"

      "## Abstract\n",
      "\n",
      "### Objective\n",
      "\n",
      "The Honduran HIV/AIDS Program began to scale up access to HIV therapy in 2002. Up to May 2008, more than 6000 patients received combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). As HIV drug resistance is the major obstacle for effective treatment, the purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of antiretroviral drug resistance in Honduran HIV-1-infected individuals.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Methods\n",
      "\n",
      "We collected samples from 138 individuals (97 adults and 41 children) on cART with virological, immunological or clinical signs of treatment failure. HIV-1 *pol* sequences were obtained using an in-house method. Resistance mutations were identified according to the 2007 International AIDS Society (IAS)-USA list and predicted susceptibility to cART was scored using the anrs algorithm.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Results\n",
      "\n",
      "Resistance mutations were detected in 112 patients (81%), 74% in adults and 98% in children. Triple-, dual- and single-class drug resistance was documented in 27%, 43% and 11% of the study subjects, respectively. Multiple logistic regression showed that resistance was independently associated with type of treatment failure \\[virological failure (odds ratio (OR)=1) *vs* . immunological failure (OR=0.11; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.030--0.43) *vs* . clinical failure (OR=0.037; 95% CI 0.0063--0.22)\\], route of transmission (OR=42.8; 95% CI 3.73--491), and years on therapy (OR=1.81; 95% CI 1.11--2.93).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The prevalence of antiretroviral resistance was high in Honduran HIV-infected patients with signs of treatment failure. A majority of study subjects showed dual- or triple-class resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors. Virologically defined treatment failure was a strong predictor of resistance, indicating that viral load testing is needed to correctly identify patients with treatment failure attributable to resistance.\n",

      "for the children. All individuals were native Hondurans; the most\n",
      "frequent route of transmission was heterosexual transmission (66%),\n",

      "\n",
      "The present study describes the prevalence of genotypic resistance to\n",
      "antiretroviral drugs in clinical samples from 138 Honduran patients who\n",
      "were failing ART. It was found that the prevalence of resistance was\n",
      "high (81%) in our study population. Thus, resistance to at least one\n",
      "drug class was found in 11% of the patients, dual class resistance was\n",
      "found in 43% of the patients and triple class resistance was found in\n",
      "27% of the patients. The proportion of individuals with resistance was\n",
      "higher among children (98%) than among adults (74%). The type of\n",
      "treatment failure (virological, immunological or clinical) was the\n",
      "strongest predictor of resistance, but route of transmission and years\n",
      "on therapy were also independently associated with the presence of\n",
      "genotypic resistance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our study revealed that there are considerable problems with resistance\n",
      "to antiretroviral drugs in Honduras. However, it is important to stress\n",
      "that our results do not reflect the prevalence of resistance among all\n",
      "HIV-infected patients in Honduras, because the study subjects were\n",
      "selected on the basis of treatment failure. Nevertheless, it is worrying\n",
      "that dual- and triple-class resistance was very common. Furthermore, we\n",
      "observed that treatment changes were common and associated with a higher\n",
      "prevalence of resistance, as was years on therapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our review of the patient records revealed that many of the treatment\n",
      "changes were not driven by laboratory results indicating treatment\n",
      "failure, primarily because access to plasma HIV-1 RNA and CD4\n",
      "quantification was irregular during the study period. Instead, treatment\n",
      "changes had often been initiated as a consequence of clinical\n",
      "progression or interrupted access to specific antiretroviral drugs.\n",
      "Thus, the resistance problems in our study population appear in part to\n",
      "be attributable to limited and interrupted access to treatment, but also\n",
      "involve problems with adherence and the prior use of mono and dual\n",
      "therapy. Importantly, the definition of treatment failure (virological,\n",
      "immunological or clinical) was the strongest predictor of resistance.\n",
      "Immunological and clinical treatment failure were categorised as\n",
      "inclusion criteria because access to plasma HIV-1 RNA and CD4\n",
      "quantification was irregular during the study period. The finding that\n",
      "immunological and clinical criteria were poor predictors of treatment\n",
      "failure attributable to resistance is important and has relevance for\n",
      "other resource-poor settings where access to VL testing may be limited.\n",
      "Our results are in agreement with recent data which also show that CD4\n",
      "cell counts and clinical criteria do not accurately identify patients\n",
      "with virological treatment failure \\[ 17--19 \\].\n",
      "\n",
      "In this study, we estimated that the overall prevalence of\n",
      "resistance-associated mutations was 81% among the investigated Honduran\n",
      "patients, who were selected on the basis of signs and symptoms of\n",
      "treatment failure. This finding agrees well with results from the United\n",
      "Kingdom (80% resistance) \\[ 10 \\], United States (76% resistance) \\[ 11\n",
      "\\], and France (88% resistance) \\[ 12 \\], in spite of the fact that the\n",
      "cART conditions in these countries are very different from those in\n",
      "Honduras. It is somewhat surprising that 19% of the 138 studied patients\n",
      "did not appear to harbour a resistant virus even though they had been\n",
      "selected as experiencing treatment failure. The absence of resistance in\n",
      "19% of the patients indicates that adherence in these patients may have\n",
      "been too low to drive the development of resistance. However, and as\n",
      "discussed above, the significant association of resistance with type of\n",
      "failure (virological, immunological or clinical) also demonstrates that\n",
      "it is difficult to monitor HIV therapy without regular access to plasma\n",
      "HIV-1 quantification. Thus, patients with adequate adherence and low\n",
      "plasma HIV RNA levels may incorrectly have been perceived to have\n",
      "immunological or clinical treatment failure.\n",
      "\n",
      "We observed that the presence of genotypic resistance was positively\n",
      "correlated with years on therapy and the number of ART regimens used.\n",
      "When this study was carried out, access in Honduras to boosted PIs was\n",
      "very limited. The broad resistance to NRTIs, NNRTIs and unboosted PIs\n",
      "indicates that many of our study subjects were in need of salvage\n",
      "therapy with boosted PIs as well as entry and integrase inhibitors \\[ 3\n",
      "\\]. Improved access to these drugs is urgently needed for these and\n",
      "other heavily treatment-experienced Honduran patients. M184V and K103N\n",
      "were the most prevalent NRTI and NNRTI mutations in our study, at 62%\n",
      "and 30%, respectively. M184V causes high-level (\\>100-fold) resistance\n",
      "to lamivudine/emtricitabine and emerges rapidly in patients who receive\n",
      "lamivudine monotherapy \\[ 20 \\]. It is also the first mutation to\n",
      "develop in patients receiving partially suppressive triple combination\n",
      "therapy including lamivudine \\[ 21--23 \\]. K103N is the most clinically\n",
      "important NNRTI resistance mutation. It causes 20- to 50-fold resistance\n",
      "to the most available NNRTIs, which is sufficient to cause virological\n",
      "failure \\[ 24,25 \\]. It was not surprising to find a high frequency of\n",
      "the K103N mutation because of the common use of NNRTIs in Honduras and\n",
      "the ability of the virus to develop NNRTI resistance mutations during\n",
      "monotherapy and during incomplete viral suppression \\[ 25 \\].\n",
      "\n",
      "Some limitations of our analysis should be mentioned. The patients were\n",
      "classified as failing their current cART based on virological,\n",
      "immunological, and/or clinical data; but some patients may incorrectly\n",
      "have been classified as failing their current regimen because access to\n",
