CRF01_AE was the major strain (43.5\\xa0%)\\nspreading across the province, second by B/Bâ² (17.9\\xa0%), CRF07_BC\\n(17.1\\xa0%), and CRF08_BC (13.7\\xa0%). The strains were mainly transmitted by\\nheterosexual contact. Novel recombinant strains and vertical\\ntransmission were occasionally reported. Floating population from other\\nprovinces accounted for a significant number of HIV-1 cases in Zhejiang.\\nThese data may provide us rational intervention strategy for further\\ncontrol of HIV dissemination.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Materials and methods\\n\\n### Ethics statement\\n\\nThe study was reviewed and approved by the ethical review committee at\\nZhejiang Provincial Center of Disease Control and Prevention (Zhejiang\\nCDC). All participants participated voluntarily in this study. Written\\ninformed consents were obtained from all involved participants in the\\nstudy.\\n\\n### Participants and specimens\\n\\nThe study was conducted in a cross-sectional and anonymous manner in all\\n11 cities, based on the surveillance of molecular epidemiology or drug\\nresistance. A total of 451 HIV-1-positive patient samples were collected\\nby local CDC staff from 2004 to 2008 (Table 1 ). Data were collected\\nusing an interviewer-administered questionnaire \\\\[ 4 \\\\]. Every\\nparticipant was assigned a unique and confidential identifier code for\\nthe questionnaire and specimens. Demographic variables were collected\\nincluding age, gender, ethnicity, transmission route, education, birth\\nplace, and current residence, etc. \\\\[ 5 \\\\].\\n\\nAll blood samples originally tested by HIV antibody ELISA (Bio-MÃ©rieux,\\nFrance) at the local CDC were confirmed using Western-blot (Genelabs\\nDiagnostics, Singapore) at Zhejiang CDC. 5\\xa0ml of EDTA-treated whole\\nblood was taken from HIV-1 patient, and all samples were transferred to\\nZhejiang CDC in less than 12\\xa0h. The blood samples were separated into\\nplasma and peripheral blood monocular cells (PBMC) and stored at â80\\xa0Â°C\\nuntil use according to standard procedures.\\n\\n### Sequencing HIV-1 gag and pol gene fragments\\n\\nViral RNA was extracted from patient plasma (140\\xa0Î¼l) using QIAamp Viral\\nRNA Mini kit (Qiagen, USA). HIV-1 cDNA was obtained through RT-PCR using\\nthe Takara One Step RNA PCR kit (Takara, China) and then subjected to\\nnested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the amplification of *gag*\\nand *pol* gene fragments, as described previously \\\\[ 6 , 7 \\\\]. The\\nportion of the *gag* gene p17--p24 region (HXB2, 836--1507 nt) \\\\[ 8 --\\n10 \\\\] and the *pol* gene fragment (HXB2, 2147--3462 nt) \\\\[ 11 , 12 \\\\]\\nwere selected for PCR amplification and phylogenetic analyses. This\\nstudy was based on the different surveillance of molecular epidemiology\\nand drug resistance. PCR products were purified using Qiagen gel\\nextraction kit, and sequenced using an automated ABI 377 DNA Sequencer\\n(Applied Biosystems).\\n\\n### Phylogenetic analysis of HIV-1 sequences\\n\\nThe resulting *gag* or *pol* gene fragments were aligned with subtype\\nreference sequences from the Los Alamos HIV database. Multiple\\nalignments were made automatically using software BioEdit 7.0 with minor\\nmanual adjustments. Phylogenetic analysis of the aligned sequences was\\nperformed using MEGA 6.0 with maximum likelihood model and bootstrap\\ntesting (1000 replicates) \\\\[ 13 \\\\]. Clusters of the sequences with\\nbootstrap values above 70\\xa0% were considered significant for defining a\\nsubtype. The subtype of the sequences was proved by the online tool\\nCOMET HIV-1( http://comet.retrovirology.lu/index.php ). Otherwise, we\\nutilized online tool RIP 3.0 from LANL HIV database, or software Simplot\\n3.0 to check and ascertain the scattered or alien sequences for subtype\\nor novel recombinant forms.\\n\\n\\n## Results\\n\\n### Sociodemographic characteristics of HIV-1 patients in Zhejiang\\n\\nThe 451 HIV-1-seropositive individuals were followed up by Zhejiang CDC\\nduring 2004--2008. As shown in Table 1 , the demographic characteristics\\nof the cases are as follows: male ( *n* =\\xa0287, 63.6\\xa0%), 30--49\\xa0years old\\n( *n* =\\xa0236, 52.3\\xa0%), Han ethnicity ( *n* =\\xa0393, 87.1\\xa0%), men who have\\nsex with men (MSM, *n* =\\xa047, 16.4\\xa0%), and less education (equal to or\\nlower than middle school level, *n* =\\xa0343, 76.1\\xa0%). Among the 287 male\\npatients, those that had heterosexual contact ( *n* =\\xa0163, 56.8\\xa0%) or\\nhomosexual ( *n* =\\xa047, 16.4\\xa0%), or using intravenous drugs ( *n* =\\xa046,\\n16.0\\xa0%) accounted for the majority of the group. According to Table 1 ,\\na majority of female cases were infected through heterosexual contact\\n(119 out of 164, 72.5\\xa0%), higher than the male ones.\\n\\nAlthough using intravenous drugs was second to heterosexual contact,\\ncausing female infections, only 16 patients were in the drug user\\ncategory. Five cases were diagnosed as infection through vertical and\\nmother-to-child (MTC) transmission.\\n\\nGeographically, 57.6\\xa0% ( *n* =\\xa0260) of the HIV-1-positive patients were\\nlocal residents from all 11 cities of the province. Except for the seven\\nunknown cases, the remaining 40.8\\xa0% ( *n* =\\xa0184) originally came from\\nthe other 23 provinces of China, including Yunnan (7.8\\xa0%, 35), Guangxi\\n(7.3\\xa0%, 33), Sichuan (5.6\\xa0%, 25), Guizhou (5.3\\xa0%, 24), Henan (4.9\\xa0%,\\n22), Chongqing (3.3\\xa0%, 15), Anhui (4.2\\xa0%, 19), Jiangxi (2.4\\xa0%, 11), and\\nothers.\\n\\n### Distributions of HIV-1 subtypes in Zhejiang\\n\\nDuring our molecular epidemiology study, the gag or env gene sequences\\nwere obtained. In drug resistance surveillance, only pol gene was\\nharvested. Totally, 332 *gag* and 229 *pol* gene fragments were\\namplified and sequenced from the 451 individual samples, respectively\\n(Supplementary files 1 and 2). Sequence analyses indicated that three\\nHIV-1 subtypes (B/B\\', C, and G), five circulating recombination forms\\n(CRF01_AE, CRF07_BC, CRF08_BC, CRF02_AG, and CRF06_CPX), and some novel\\nrecombinant strains were detected. It was reported that the sensitivity\\nand specificity among various subtyping tools might be different \\\\[ 14\\n\\\\], all the sequences were checked again by the statistical-based tool\\nCOMET HIV. In consistence with Pineda-Pena\\'s results, we found only one\\nsequence (2007_ZheJiang_HZ07ZJ191) which was evidence of\\nCRF01_AE-CRF08_BC recombination, suggesting that the sensitivity and\\nspecificity were high for CRF01_AE subtyping between statistical-based\\nand phylogenetic-based tools.\\n\\nCRF01_AE was the major strain, infecting 196 cases (43.5\\xa0%), and it was\\nmainly distributed through heterosexual contact. Then, subtype B/B\\'\\n(Thai-B) took second place, accounting for 17.9\\xa0%, dominant in blood\\ntransfusion. The CRF07_BC and CRF08_BC strains accounted for 17.1 and\\n13.7\\xa0% infections, respectively, mainly infecting patients through IDU\\n(Figs. 1 , 2 ). The rest strains (35 cases, 7.8\\xa0%) included CRF02_AG (8\\ncases), CRF06_CPX (2 case), subtype G (2 case), subtype C (10 cases),\\nand 13 potentially novel recombinant strains (CRF07-CRF08, CRF01-C, and\\nCRF01-B). With the epidemic progress, the population of CRF01_AE\\ninfection was prone to be expanded (Fig. 3 ).\\n\\nIn other words, the results indicated that the major prevalent strains\\nfrom 2004 to 2008 in Zhejiang Province were CRF01_AE, B/B\\', CRF07_BC,\\nand CRF08_BC, which comprised 92.2\\xa0% of the 451 total cases.\\n\\n### Dynamics of HIV-1 transmission in Zhejiang during 2004--2008\\n\\nThe study participants were mainly infected through heterosexual contact\\n( *n* =\\xa0282, 62.5\\xa0%). Infections caused by intravenous drug use, MSM,\\nblood transfusion, and MTC transmission accounted for only 62 (13.7\\xa0%),\\n47 (10.4\\xa0%), 30 (6.7\\xa0%), and 5 (1.1\\xa0%) cases, respectively. The\\ntransmission routes of other 25 cases could not be confirmed (Fig. 2 ).\\nThese results were consistent with the observations of our previous\\nsurveys, which indicated that the main transmission route was\\nheterosexual contact in Zhejiang from 2004 to 2008 \\\\[ 15 \\\\]. In recent\\nyears, with the increase of sexually transmitted cases, the disease\\nraised awareness among MSM \\\\[ 16 , 17 \\\\]. Only two cases (2/25, 8.0\\xa0%)\\nof MSM were reported for the first time in 2004. By 2008, the numbers of\\ninfection via homosexual individuals had slightly increased (14/116,\\n12.1\\xa0%), suggesting the possibility of expanded prevalence in the MSM\\npopulation. Therefore, effective intervention measures should be taken\\nto control the spread of HIV in this population.\\n\\n### The phylogenetic inference of HIV sequence\\n\\nThe phylogenetic tree was constructed according to the *gag* gene\\nsequences in Zhejiang. The tree of CRF01_AE *gag* gene indicated that\\nthere was no obvious regional or time correlation, regardless of the\\noriginal residence, sampling time or transmission routes (Fig. 4 ). And\\nthe distributions of CRF01_AE strains intermingled, which could be\\nassociated with the high population mobility in Zhejiang. Similar\\nresults were obtained with phylogenetic analysis of *gag* gene sequences\\nof other subtypes, and *pol* gene sequences. Based on these\\nobservations, we speculated that imported HIV-1 infection cases played a\\nsignificant role in the epidemic in Zhejiang, and more necessary\\nattention should be paid to provide a rational intervention strategy\\nagainst HIV dissemination.\\n\\n\\n## Discussion\\n\\nAfter the first reported HIV-1 case in China in the mid-1980s, various\\nsubtypes and high diversity were reported in Zhejiang gradually. To\\ndate, eight subtypes or CRFs were identified in our study, and these\\nstrains were also reported to be circulating elsewhere \\\\[ 18 -- 24 \\\\].\\n\\nCRF01_AE in our study was the dominant strain circulating in Zhejiang\\naccounting for 43.5\\xa0% infection, across all transmission routes and with\\nthe trend of expansion. The CRF01_AE, which was originally identified in\\nThailand in 1989, appears to in major parts of Asia, particularly\\nSoutheast Asia \\\\[ 25 , 26 \\\\]. In China, CRF01_AE strains were first\\nidentified among persons at risk of sexual transmission and IDUs in the\\nsouthwest provinces of Yunnan and Guangxi in the early 1990s \\\\[ 27 -- 29\\n\\\\].The Subsequent nationwide molecular epidemiological surveys in\\n1996--2002 indicated that the early spread of CRF01_AE was limited to\\nthe eastern coastal areas and southwest border provinces, predominantly\\nin heterosexual populations \\\\[ 30 , 31 \\\\]. Phylogenetic analyses in Fig.\\n4 indicated the CRF01_AE sequences were intermingled, irrespective of\\nthe sampling regions, sampling years and transmission routes, and there\\nwere no close relationships or large sub-clusters with sequences.\\nTherefore, it might be possible that the initial of CRF01_AE in Zhejiang\\ncould be the result of vastly increased international travel to and from\\nChina, starting in the early 1990s when the Chinese government began\\nrelaxing border restrictions to Chinese citizens for unofficial\\ninternational travel. Meanwhile, we noticed that imported HIV infections\\noutside Zhejiang and floating population comprised a significant\\npercentage of the epidemic in the province. Local residents of Zhejiang\\naccounted for approximately 57.6\\xa0% individuals, and floating population\\ncontributed to 40.8\\xa0% infections from other 23 provinces of China. Most\\ncases ( *n* =\\xa0282, 62.5\\xa0%) were infected through heterosexual contact in\\nZhejiang. Among them, 96 were diagnosed as residents outside Zhejiang,\\nsuch as Yunnan, Guangxi, Guangdong where HIV-1 CRF01_AE has a high\\nprevalence \\\\[ 32 -- 34 \\\\]. So there is another possibility that the\\nfloating population may function great to the epidemic increase,\\nbringing strains to or from Zhejiang. However, the rare strains like\\nCRF02_AG, G and CRF06_CPX mainly appeared in Zhoushan City, the\\nsettlement of native ocean-going fishermen who have traveled abroad for\\nwork.\\n\\nIn this study, we observed 13 novel recombinant strains including\\nCRF07-CRF08, CRF01-B, and CRF01-C. So many different strains were\\nco-circulating here, and some strains shuffled among different\\npopulation or transmission routes. All these brought an ideal platform\\nfor super-infection and the descendants of novel recombinant strains.\\n\\nInterestingly, we observed several vertical or transmission events were\\nreported during these years. The population infected through MSM was\\ngradually increased from 2004 to 2008 in Zhejiang. Otherwise, we\\nobserved some novel recombinant strains there. The newly expanded\\nepidemic should be paid more attention and efficient measures should be\\ntaken to control the transmission.\\n\\nOverall, the recent 5-years HIV-1 epidemic in Zhejiang was summarized in\\nthis study. The results revealed that CRF01_AE became the current major\\ncirculating strain and heterosexual contact was the major transmission\\nroute. High HIV-1 diversity was noted, which could be a factor that\\ncould accelerate this pandemic. The floating population contributed a\\ngreat deal to the epidemic; therefore, intervention for this group\\nshould be a new focus of HIV prevention and control strategies. These\\ndata may be significant in further clarifying the AIDS epidemic.\\n\\nAcknowledgments We gratefully acknowledge the contributions of\\nthe HIV-1 patients who participated in this study and also thank the\\nstaff of Zhejiang and the local CDC for recruiting participants, col-\\nlecting the samples, and technical assistance.

      "### Ethics statement\n",
      "\n",
      "The study was reviewed and approved by the ethical review committee at\n",
      "Zhejiang Provincial Center of Disease Control and Prevention (Zhejiang\n",
      "CDC). All participants participated voluntarily in this study. Written\n",
      "informed consents were obtained from all involved participants in the\n",
      "study.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Participants and specimens\n",
      "\n",
      "The study was conducted in a cross-sectional and anonymous manner in all\n",
      "11 cities, based on the surveillance of molecular epidemiology or drug\n",
      "resistance. A total of 451 HIV-1-positive patient samples were collected\n",
      "by local CDC staff from 2004 to 2008 (Table 1 ). Data were collected\n",
      "using an interviewer-administered questionnaire \\[ 4 \\]. Every\n",
      "participant was assigned a unique and confidential identifier code for\n",
      "the questionnaire and specimens. Demographic variables were collected\n",
      "including age, gender, ethnicity, transmission route, education, birth\n",
      "place, and current residence, etc. \\[ 5 \\].\n",
      "\n",
      "All blood samples originally tested by HIV antibody ELISA (Bio-MÃ©rieux,\n",
      "France) at the local CDC were confirmed using Western-blot (Genelabs\n",
      "Diagnostics, Singapore) at Zhejiang CDC. 5Â ml of EDTA-treated whole\n",
      "blood was taken from HIV-1 patient, and all samples were transferred to\n",
      "Zhejiang CDC in less than 12Â h. The blood samples were separated into\n",

      "\n",
      "### Phylogenetic analysis of HIV-1 sequences\n",
      "\n",
      "The resulting *gag* or *pol* gene fragments were aligned with subtype\n",
      "reference sequences from the Los Alamos HIV database. Multiple\n",

      "testing (1000 replicates) \\[ 13 \\]. Clusters of the sequences with\n",
      "bootstrap values above 70Â % were considered significant for defining a\n",
      "subtype. The subtype of the sequences was proved by the online tool\n",
      "COMET HIV-1( http://comet.retrovirology.lu/index.php ). Otherwise, we\n",

      "of the cases are as follows: male ( *n* =Â 287, 63.6Â %), 30--49Â years old\n",
      "( *n* =Â 236, 52.3Â %), Han ethnicity ( *n* =Â 393, 87.1Â %), men who have\n",

      "category. Five cases were diagnosed as infection through vertical and\n",
      "mother-to-child (MTC) transmission.\n",
      "\n",
      "Geographically, 57.6Â % ( *n* =Â 260) of the HIV-1-positive patients were\n",
      "local residents from all 11 cities of the province. Except for the seven\n",
      "unknown cases, the remaining 40.8Â % ( *n* =Â 184) originally came from\n",
      "the other 23 provinces of China, including Yunnan (7.8Â %, 35), Guangxi\n",

      "### Distributions of HIV-1 subtypes in Zhejiang\n",
      "\n",
      "During our molecular epidemiology study, the gag or env gene sequences\n",
      "were obtained. In drug resistance surveillance, only pol gene was\n",

      "amplified and sequenced from the 451 individual samples, respectively\n",
      "(Supplementary files 1 and 2). Sequence analyses indicated that three\n",

      "(CRF01_AE, CRF07_BC, CRF08_BC, CRF02_AG, and CRF06_CPX), and some novel\n",
      "recombinant strains were detected. It was reported that the sensitivity\n",
      "and specificity among various subtyping tools might be different \\[ 14\n",
      "\\], all the sequences were checked again by the statistical-based tool\n",
      "COMET HIV. In consistence with Pineda-Pena's results, we found only one\n",
      "sequence (2007_ZheJiang_HZ07ZJ191) which was evidence of\n",
      "CRF01_AE-CRF08_BC recombination, suggesting that the sensitivity and\n",
      "specificity were high for CRF01_AE subtyping between statistical-based\n",
      "and phylogenetic-based tools.\n",
      "\n",
      "CRF01_AE was the major strain, infecting 196 cases (43.5Â %), and it was\n",
      "mainly distributed through heterosexual contact. Then, subtype B/B'\n",
      "(Thai-B) took second place, accounting for 17.9Â %, dominant in blood\n",
      "transfusion. The CRF07_BC and CRF08_BC strains accounted for 17.1 and\n",
      "13.7Â % infections, respectively, mainly infecting patients through IDU\n",
      "(Figs. 1 , 2 ). The rest strains (35 cases, 7.8Â %) included CRF02_AG (8\n",
      "cases), CRF06_CPX (2 case), subtype G (2 case), subtype C (10 cases),\n",
      "and 13 potentially novel recombinant strains (CRF07-CRF08, CRF01-C, and\n",
      "CRF01-B). With the epidemic progress, the population of CRF01_AE\n",
      "infection was prone to be expanded (Fig. 3 ).\n",
      "\n",
      "In other words, the results indicated that the major prevalent strains\n",
      "from 2004 to 2008 in Zhejiang Province were CRF01_AE, B/B', CRF07_BC,\n",
      "and CRF08_BC, which comprised 92.2Â % of the 451 total cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Dynamics of HIV-1 transmission in Zhejiang during 2004--2008\n",
      "\n",
      "The study participants were mainly infected through heterosexual contact\n",
      "( *n* =Â 282, 62.5Â %). Infections caused by intravenous drug use, MSM,\n",
      "blood transfusion, and MTC transmission accounted for only 62 (13.7Â %),\n",
      "47 (10.4Â %), 30 (6.7Â %), and 5 (1.1Â %) cases, respectively. The\n",
      "transmission routes of other 25 cases could not be confirmed (Fig. 2 ).\n",
      "These results were consistent with the observations of our previous\n",
      "surveys, which indicated that the main transmission route was\n",
      "heterosexual contact in Zhejiang from 2004 to 2008 \\[ 15 \\]. In recent\n",
      "years, with the increase of sexually transmitted cases, the disease\n",
      "raised awareness among MSM \\[ 16 , 17 \\]. Only two cases (2/25, 8.0Â %)\n",
      "of MSM were reported for the first time in 2004. By 2008, the numbers of\n",
      "infection via homosexual individuals had slightly increased (14/116,\n",
      "12.1Â %), suggesting the possibility of expanded prevalence in the MSM\n",
      "population. Therefore, effective intervention measures should be taken\n",
      "to control the spread of HIV in this population.\n",
      "\n",
      "### The phylogenetic inference of HIV sequence\n",
      "\n",
      "The phylogenetic tree was constructed according to the *gag* gene\n",
      "sequences in Zhejiang. The tree of CRF01_AE *gag* gene indicated that\n",
      "there was no obvious regional or time correlation, regardless of the\n",
      "original residence, sampling time or transmission routes (Fig. 4 ). And\n",
      "the distributions of CRF01_AE strains intermingled, which could be\n",
      "associated with the high population mobility in Zhejiang. Similar\n",
      "results were obtained with phylogenetic analysis of *gag* gene sequences\n",
      "of other subtypes, and *pol* gene sequences. Based on these\n",
      "observations, we speculated that imported HIV-1 infection cases played a\n",
      "significant role in the epidemic in Zhejiang, and more necessary\n",
      "attention should be paid to provide a rational intervention strategy\n",
      "against HIV dissemination.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Discussion\n",
      "\n",
      "After the first reported HIV-1 case in China in the mid-1980s, various\n",
      "subtypes and high diversity were reported in Zhejiang gradually. To\n",
      "date, eight subtypes or CRFs were identified in our study, and these\n",
      "strains were also reported to be circulating elsewhere \\[ 18 -- 24 \\].\n",
      "\n",
      "CRF01_AE in our study was the dominant strain circulating in Zhejiang\n",
      "accounting for 43.5Â % infection, across all transmission routes and with\n",
      "the trend of expansion. The CRF01_AE, which was originally identified in\n",
      "Thailand in 1989, appears to in major parts of Asia, particularly\n",
      "Southeast Asia \\[ 25 , 26 \\]. In China, CRF01_AE strains were first\n",
      "identified among persons at risk of sexual transmission and IDUs in the\n",
      "southwest provinces of Yunnan and Guangxi in the early 1990s \\[ 27 -- 29\n",
      "\\].The Subsequent nationwide molecular epidemiological surveys in\n",
      "1996--2002 indicated that the early spread of CRF01_AE was limited to\n",
      "the eastern coastal areas and southwest border provinces, predominantly\n",
      "in heterosexual populations \\[ 30 , 31 \\]. Phylogenetic analyses in Fig.\n",
      "4 indicated the CRF01_AE sequences were intermingled, irrespective of\n",
      "the sampling regions, sampling years and transmission routes, and there\n",
      "were no close relationships or large sub-clusters with sequences.\n",
      "Therefore, it might be possible that the initial of CRF01_AE in Zhejiang\n",
      "could be the result of vastly increased international travel to and from\n",
      "China, starting in the early 1990s when the Chinese government began\n",
      "relaxing border restrictions to Chinese citizens for unofficial\n",
      "international travel. Meanwhile, we noticed that imported HIV infections\n",
      "outside Zhejiang and floating population comprised a significant\n",
      "percentage of the epidemic in the province. Local residents of Zhejiang\n",
      "accounted for approximately 57.6Â % individuals, and floating population\n",
      "contributed to 40.8Â % infections from other 23 provinces of China. Most\n",
      "cases ( *n* =Â 282, 62.5Â %) were infected through heterosexual contact in\n",
      "Zhejiang. Among them, 96 were diagnosed as residents outside Zhejiang,\n",
      "such as Yunnan, Guangxi, Guangdong where HIV-1 CRF01_AE has a high\n",
      "prevalence \\[ 32 -- 34 \\]. So there is another possibility that the\n",
      "floating population may function great to the epidemic increase,\n",
      "bringing strains to or from Zhejiang. However, the rare strains like\n",
      "CRF02_AG, G and CRF06_CPX mainly appeared in Zhoushan City, the\n",
      "settlement of native ocean-going fishermen who have traveled abroad for\n",
      "work.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this study, we observed 13 novel recombinant strains including\n",
      "CRF07-CRF08, CRF01-B, and CRF01-C. So many different strains were\n",
      "co-circulating here, and some strains shuffled among different\n",
      "population or transmission routes. All these brought an ideal platform\n",
      "for super-infection and the descendants of novel recombinant strains.\n",
      "\n",
      "Interestingly, we observed several vertical or transmission events were\n",
      "reported during these years. The population infected through MSM was\n",
      "gradually increased from 2004 to 2008 in Zhejiang. Otherwise, we\n",
      "observed some novel recombinant strains there. The newly expanded\n",
      "epidemic should be paid more attention and efficient measures should be\n",
      "taken to control the transmission.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the recent 5-years HIV-1 epidemic in Zhejiang was summarized in\n",
      "this study. The results revealed that CRF01_AE became the current major\n",
      "circulating strain and heterosexual contact was the major transmission\n",
      "route. High HIV-1 diversity was noted, which could be a factor that\n",
      "could accelerate this pandemic. The floating population contributed a\n",
      "great deal to the epidemic; therefore, intervention for this group\n",
      "should be a new focus of HIV prevention and control strategies. These\n",
      "data may be significant in further clarifying the AIDS epidemic.\n",
